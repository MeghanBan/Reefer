<canto number="I">

<l>Midway upon the journey of our life</l>
<l>I found myself within a forest dark,</l>
<l>For the straightforward pathway had been lost.</l>

<l>Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say</l>
<l>What was this forest savage, rough, and stern,</l>
<l>Which in the very thought renews the fear.</l>

<l>So bitter is it, death is little more;</l>
<l>But of the good to treat, which there I found,</l>
<l>Speak will I of the other things I saw there.</l>

<l>I cannot well repeat how there I entered,</l>
<l>So full was I of slumber at the moment</l>
<l>In which I had abandoned the true way.</l>

<l>But after I had reached a mountain's foot,</l>
<l>At that point where the valley terminated,</l>
<l>Which had with consternation pierced my heart,</l>

<l>Upward I looked, and I beheld its shoulders,</l>
<l>Vested already with that planet's rays</l>
<l>Which leadeth others right by every road.</l>

<l>Then was the fear a little quieted</l>
<l>That in my heart's lake had endured throughout</l>
<l>The night, which I had passed so piteously.</l>

<l>And even as he, who, with distressful breath,</l>
<l>Forth issued from the sea upon the shore,</l>
<l>Turns to the water perilous and gazes;</l>

<l>So did my soul, that still was fleeing onward,</l>
<l>Turn itself back to re-behold the pass</l>
<l>Which never yet a living person left.</l>

<l>After my weary body I had rested,</l>
<l>The way resumed I on the desert slope,</l>
<l>So that the firm foot ever was the lower.</l>

<l>And lo! almost where the ascent began,</l>
<l>A panther light and swift exceedingly,</l>
<l>Which with a spotted skin was covered o'er!</l>

<l>And never moved she from before my face,</l>
<l>Nay, rather did impede so much my way,</l>
<l>That many times I to return had turned.</l>

<l>The time was the beginning of the morning,</l>
<l>And up the sun was mounting with those stars</l>
<l>That with him were, what time the Love Divine</l>

<l>At first in motion set those beauteous things;</l>
<l>So were to me occasion of good hope,</l>
<l>The variegated skin of that wild beast,</l>

<l>The hour of time, and the delicious season;</l>
<l>But not so much, that did not give me fear</l>
<l>A lion's aspect which appeared to me.</l>

<l>He seemed as if against me he were coming</l>
<l>With head uplifted, and with ravenous hunger,</l>
<l>So that it seemed the air was afraid of him;</l>

<l>And a she-wolf, that with all hungerings</l>
<l>Seemed to be laden in her meagreness,</l>
<l>And many folk has caused to live forlorn!</l>

<l>She brought upon me so much heaviness,</l>
<l>With the affright that from her aspect came,</l>
<l>That I the hope relinquished of the height.</l>

<l>And as he is who willingly acquires,</l>
<l>And the time comes that causes him to lose,</l>
<l>Who weeps in all his thoughts and is despondent,</l>

<l>E'en such made me that beast withouten peace,</l>
<l>Which, coming on against me by degrees</l>
<l>Thrust me back thither where the sun is silent.</l>

<l>While I was rushing downward to the lowland,</l>
<l>Before mine eyes did one present himself,</l>
<l>Who seemed from long-continued silence hoarse.</l>

<l>When I beheld him in the desert vast,</l>
<l>"Have pity on me," unto him I cried,</l>
<l>"Whiche'er thou art, or shade or real man!"</l>

<l>He answered me: "Not man; man once I was,</l>
<l>And both my parents were of Lombardy,</l>
<l>And Mantuans by country both of them.</l>

<l>'Sub Julio' was I born, though it was late,</l>
<l>And lived at Rome under the good Augustus,</l>
<l>During the time of false and lying gods.</l>

<l>A poet was I, and I sang that just</l>
<l>Son of Anchises, who came forth from Troy,</l>
<l>After that Ilion the superb was burned.</l>

<l>But thou, why goest thou back to such annoyance?</l>
<l>Why climb'st thou not the Mount Delectable,</l>
<l>Which is the source and cause of every joy?"</l>

<l>"Now, art thou that Virgilius and that fountain</l>
<l>Which spreads abroad so wide a river of speech?"</l>
<l>I made response to him with bashful forehead.</l>

<l>"O, of the other poets honour and light,</l>
<l>Avail me the long study and great love</l>
<l>That have impelled me to explore thy volume!</l>

<l>Thou art my master, and my author thou,</l>
<l>Thou art alone the one from whom I took</l>
<l>The beautiful style that has done honour to me.</l>

<l>Behold the beast, for which I have turned back;</l>
<l>Do thou protect me from her, famous Sage,</l>
<l>For she doth make my veins and pulses tremble."</l>

<l>"Thee it behoves to take another road,"</l>
<l>Responded he, when he beheld me weeping,</l>
<l>"If from this savage place thou wouldst escape;</l>

<l>Because this beast, at which thou criest out,</l>
<l>Suffers not any one to pass her way,</l>
<l>But so doth harass him, that she destroys him;</l>

<l>And has a nature so malign and ruthless,</l>
<l>That never doth she glut her greedy will,</l>
<l>And after food is hungrier than before.</l>

<l>Many the animals with whom she weds,</l>
<l>And more they shall be still, until the Greyhound</l>
<l>Comes, who shall make her perish in her pain.</l>

<l>He shall not feed on either earth or pelf,</l>
<l>But upon wisdom, and on love and virtue;</l>
<l>'Twixt Feltro and Feltro shall his nation be;</l>

<l>Of that low Italy shall he be the saviour,</l>
<l>On whose account the maid Camilla died,</l>
<l>Euryalus, Turnus, Nisus, of their wounds;</l>

<l>Through every city shall he hunt her down,</l>
<l>Until he shall have driven her back to Hell,</l>
<l>There from whence envy first did let her loose.</l>

<l>Therefore I think and judge it for thy best</l>
<l>Thou follow me, and I will be thy guide,</l>
<l>And lead thee hence through the eternal place,</l>

<l>Where thou shalt hear the desperate lamentations,</l>
<l>Shalt see the ancient spirits disconsolate,</l>
<l>Who cry out each one for the second death;</l>

<l>And thou shalt see those who contented are</l>
<l>Within the fire, because they hope to come,</l>
<l>Whene'er it may be, to the blessed people;</l>

<l>To whom, then, if thou wishest to ascend,</l>
<l>A soul shall be for that than I more worthy;</l>
<l>With her at my departure I will leave thee;</l>

<l>Because that Emperor, who reigns above,</l>
<l>In that I was rebellious to his law,</l>
<l>Wills that through me none come into his city.</l>

<l>He governs everywhere, and there he reigns;</l>
<l>There is his city and his lofty throne;</l>
<l>O happy he whom thereto he elects!"</l>

<l>And I to him: "Poet, I thee entreat,</l>
<l>By that same God whom thou didst never know,</l>
<l>So that I may escape this woe and worse,</l>

<l>Thou wouldst conduct me there where thou hast said,</l>
<l>That I may see the portal of Saint Peter,</l>
<l>And those thou makest so disconsolate."</l>

<l>Then he moved on, and I behind him followed.</l>

</canto>
<canto number="II">

<l>Day was departing, and the embrowned air</l>
<l>Released the animals that are on earth</l>
<l>From their fatigues; and I the only one</l>

<l>Made myself ready to sustain the war,</l>
<l>Both of the way and likewise of the woe,</l>
<l>Which memory that errs not shall retrace.</l>

<l>O Muses, O high genius, now assist me!</l>
<l>O memory, that didst write down what I saw,</l>
<l>Here thy nobility shall be manifest!</l>

<l>And I began: "Poet, who guidest me,</l>
<l>Regard my manhood, if it be sufficient,</l>
<l>Ere to the arduous pass thou dost confide me.</l>

<l>Thou sayest, that of Silvius the parent,</l>
<l>While yet corruptible, unto the world</l>
<l>Immortal went, and was there bodily.</l>

<l>But if the adversary of all evil</l>
<l>Was courteous, thinking of the high effect</l>
<l>That issue would from him, and who, and what,</l>

<l>To men of intellect unmeet it seems not;</l>
<l>For he was of great Rome, and of her empire</l>
<l>In the empyreal heaven as father chosen;</l>

<l>The which and what, wishing to speak the truth,</l>
<l>Were stablished as the holy place, wherein</l>
<l>Sits the successor of the greatest Peter.</l>

<l>Upon this journey, whence thou givest him vaunt,</l>
<l>Things did he hear, which the occasion were</l>
<l>Both of his victory and the papal mantle.</l>

<l>Thither went afterwards the Chosen Vessel,</l>
<l>To bring back comfort thence unto that Faith,</l>
<l>Which of salvation's way is the beginning.</l>

<l>But I, why thither come, or who concedes it?</l>
<l>I not Aeneas am, I am not Paul,</l>
<l>Nor I, nor others, think me worthy of it.</l>

<l>Therefore, if I resign myself to come,</l>
<l>I fear the coming may be ill-advised;</l>
<l>Thou'rt wise, and knowest better than I speak."</l>

<l>And as he is, who unwills what he willed,</l>
<l>And by new thoughts doth his intention change,</l>
<l>So that from his design he quite withdraws,</l>

<l>Such I became, upon that dark hillside,</l>
<l>Because, in thinking, I consumed the emprise,</l>
<l>Which was so very prompt in the beginning.</l>

<l>"If I have well thy language understood,"</l>
<l>Replied that shade of the Magnanimous,</l>
<l>"Thy soul attainted is with cowardice,</l>

<l>Which many times a man encumbers so,</l>
<l>It turns him back from honoured enterprise,</l>
<l>As false sight doth a beast, when he is shy.</l>

<l>That thou mayst free thee from this apprehension,</l>
<l>I'll tell thee why I came, and what I heard</l>
<l>At the first moment when I grieved for thee.</l>

<l>Among those was I who are in suspense,</l>
<l>And a fair, saintly Lady called to me</l>
<l>In such wise, I besought her to command me.</l>

<l>Her eyes where shining brighter than the Star;</l>
<l>And she began to say, gentle and low,</l>
<l>With voice angelical, in her own language:</l>

<l>'O spirit courteous of Mantua,</l>
<l>Of whom the fame still in the world endures,</l>
<l>And shall endure, long-lasting as the world;</l>

<l>A friend of mine, and not the friend of fortune,</l>
<l>Upon the desert slope is so impeded</l>
<l>Upon his way, that he has turned through terror,</l>

<l>And may, I fear, already be so lost,</l>
<l>That I too late have risen to his succour,</l>
<l>From that which I have heard of him in Heaven.</l>

<l>Bestir thee now, and with thy speech ornate,</l>
<l>And with what needful is for his release,</l>
<l>Assist him so, that I may be consoled.</l>

<l>Beatrice am I, who do bid thee go;</l>
<l>I come from there, where I would fain return;</l>
<l>Love moved me, which compelleth me to speak.</l>

<l>When I shall be in presence of my Lord,</l>
<l>Full often will I praise thee unto him.'</l>
<l>Then paused she, and thereafter I began:</l>

<l>'O Lady of virtue, thou alone through whom</l>
<l>The human race exceedeth all contained</l>
<l>Within the heaven that has the lesser circles,</l>

<l>So grateful unto me is thy commandment,</l>
<l>To obey, if 'twere already done, were late;</l>
<l>No farther need'st thou ope to me thy wish.</l>

<l>But the cause tell me why thou dost not shun</l>
<l>The here descending down into this centre,</l>
<l>From the vast place thou burnest to return to.'</l>

<l>'Since thou wouldst fain so inwardly discern,</l>
<l>Briefly will I relate,' she answered me,</l>
<l>'Why I am not afraid to enter here.</l>

<l>Of those things only should one be afraid</l>
<l>Which have the power of doing others harm;</l>
<l>Of the rest, no; because they are not fearful.</l>

<l>God in his mercy such created me</l>
<l>That misery of yours attains me not,</l>
<l>Nor any flame assails me of this burning.</l>

<l>A gentle Lady is in Heaven, who grieves</l>
<l>At this impediment, to which I send thee,</l>
<l>So that stern judgment there above is broken.</l>

<l>In her entreaty she besought Lucia,</l>
<l>And said, "Thy faithful one now stands in need</l>
<l>Of thee, and unto thee I recommend him."</l>

<l>Lucia, foe of all that cruel is,</l>
<l>Hastened away, and came unto the place</l>
<l>Where I was sitting with the ancient Rachel.</l>

<l>"Beatrice" said she, "the true praise of God,</l>
<l>Why succourest thou not him, who loved thee so,</l>
<l>For thee he issued from the vulgar herd?</l>

<l>Dost thou not hear the pity of his plaint?</l>
<l>Dost thou not see the death that combats him</l>
<l>Beside that flood, where ocean has no vaunt?"</l>

<l>Never were persons in the world so swift</l>
<l>To work their weal and to escape their woe,</l>
<l>As I, after such words as these were uttered,</l>

<l>Came hither downward from my blessed seat,</l>
<l>Confiding in thy dignified discourse,</l>
<l>Which honours thee, and those who've listened to it.'</l>

<l>After she thus had spoken unto me,</l>
<l>Weeping, her shining eyes she turned away;</l>
<l>Whereby she made me swifter in my coming;</l>

<l>And unto thee I came, as she desired;</l>
<l>I have delivered thee from that wild beast,</l>
<l>Which barred the beautiful mountain's short ascent.</l>

<l>What is it, then?  Why, why dost thou delay?</l>
<l>Why is such baseness bedded in thy heart?</l>
<l>Daring and hardihood why hast thou not,</l>

<l>Seeing that three such Ladies benedight</l>
<l>Are caring for thee in the court of Heaven,</l>
<l>And so much good my speech doth promise thee?"</l>

<l>Even as the flowerets, by nocturnal chill,</l>
<l>Bowed down and closed, when the sun whitens them,</l>
<l>Uplift themselves all open on their stems;</l>

<l>Such I became with my exhausted strength,</l>
<l>And such good courage to my heart there coursed,</l>
<l>That I began, like an intrepid person:</l>

<l>"O she compassionate, who succoured me,</l>
<l>And courteous thou, who hast obeyed so soon</l>
<l>The words of truth which she addressed to thee!</l>

<l>Thou hast my heart so with desire disposed</l>
<l>To the adventure, with these words of thine,</l>
<l>That to my first intent I have returned.</l>

<l>Now go, for one sole will is in us both,</l>
<l>Thou Leader, and thou Lord, and Master thou."</l>
<l>Thus said I to him; and when he had moved,</l>

<l>I entered on the deep and savage way.</l>

</canto>
<canto number="III">

<l>"Through me the way is to the city dolent;</l>
<l>Through me the way is to eternal dole;</l>
<l>Through me the way among the people lost.</l>

<l>Justice incited my sublime Creator;</l>
<l>Created me divine Omnipotence,</l>
<l>The highest Wisdom and the primal Love.</l>

<l>Before me there were no created things,</l>
<l>Only eterne, and I eternal last.</l>
<l>All hope abandon, ye who enter in!"</l>

<l>These words in sombre colour I beheld</l>
<l>Written upon the summit of a gate;</l>
<l>Whence I: "Their sense is, Master, hard to me!"</l>

<l>And he to me, as one experienced:</l>
<l>"Here all suspicion needs must be abandoned,</l>
<l>All cowardice must needs be here extinct.</l>

<l>We to the place have come, where I have told thee</l>
<l>Thou shalt behold the people dolorous</l>
<l>Who have foregone the good of intellect."</l>

<l>And after he had laid his hand on mine</l>
<l>With joyful mien, whence I was comforted,</l>
<l>He led me in among the secret things.</l>

<l>There sighs, complaints, and ululations loud</l>
<l>Resounded through the air without a star,</l>
<l>Whence I, at the beginning, wept thereat.</l>

<l>Languages diverse, horrible dialects,</l>
<l>Accents of anger, words of agony,</l>
<l>And voices high and hoarse, with sound of hands,</l>

<l>Made up a tumult that goes whirling on</l>
<l>For ever in that air for ever black,</l>
<l>Even as the sand doth, when the whirlwind breathes.</l>

<l>And I, who had my head with horror bound,</l>
<l>Said: "Master, what is this which now I hear?</l>
<l>What folk is this, which seems by pain so vanquished?"</l>

<l>And he to me: "This miserable mode</l>
<l>Maintain the melancholy souls of those</l>
<l>Who lived withouten infamy or praise.</l>

<l>Commingled are they with that caitiff choir</l>
<l>Of Angels, who have not rebellious been,</l>
<l>Nor faithful were to God, but were for self.</l>

<l>The heavens expelled them, not to be less fair;</l>
<l>Nor them the nethermore abyss receives,</l>
<l>For glory none the damned would have from them."</l>

<l>And I: "O Master, what so grievous is</l>
<l>To these, that maketh them lament so sore?"</l>
<l>He answered: "I will tell thee very briefly.</l>

<l>These have no longer any hope of death;</l>
<l>And this blind life of theirs is so debased,</l>
<l>They envious are of every other fate.</l>

<l>No fame of them the world permits to be;</l>
<l>Misericord and Justice both disdain them.</l>
<l>Let us not speak of them, but look, and pass."</l>

<l>And I, who looked again, beheld a banner,</l>
<l>Which, whirling round, ran on so rapidly,</l>
<l>That of all pause it seemed to me indignant;</l>

<l>And after it there came so long a train</l>
<l>Of people, that I ne'er would have believed</l>
<l>That ever Death so many had undone.</l>

<l>When some among them I had recognised,</l>
<l>I looked, and I beheld the shade of him</l>
<l>Who made through cowardice the great refusal.</l>

<l>Forthwith I comprehended, and was certain,</l>
<l>That this the sect was of the caitiff wretches</l>
<l>Hateful to God and to his enemies.</l>

<l>These miscreants, who never were alive,</l>
<l>Were naked, and were stung exceedingly</l>
<l>By gadflies and by hornets that were there.</l>

<l>These did their faces irrigate with blood,</l>
<l>Which, with their tears commingled, at their feet</l>
<l>By the disgusting worms was gathered up.</l>

<l>And when to gazing farther I betook me.</l>
<l>People I saw on a great river's bank;</l>
<l>Whence said I: "Master, now vouchsafe to me,</l>

<l>That I may know who these are, and what law</l>
<l>Makes them appear so ready to pass over,</l>
<l>As I discern athwart the dusky light."</l>

<l>And he to me: "These things shall all be known</l>
<l>To thee, as soon as we our footsteps stay</l>
<l>Upon the dismal shore of Acheron."</l>

<l>Then with mine eyes ashamed and downward cast,</l>
<l>Fearing my words might irksome be to him,</l>
<l>From speech refrained I till we reached the river.</l>

<l>And lo! towards us coming in a boat</l>
<l>An old man, hoary with the hair of eld,</l>
<l>Crying: "Woe unto you, ye souls depraved!</l>

<l>Hope nevermore to look upon the heavens;</l>
<l>I come to lead you to the other shore,</l>
<l>To the eternal shades in heat and frost.</l>

<l>And thou, that yonder standest, living soul,</l>
<l>Withdraw thee from these people, who are dead!"</l>
<l>But when he saw that I did not withdraw,</l>

<l>He said: "By other ways, by other ports</l>
<l>Thou to the shore shalt come, not here, for passage;</l>
<l>A lighter vessel needs must carry thee."</l>

<l>And unto him the Guide: "Vex thee not, Charon;</l>
<l>It is so willed there where is power to do</l>
<l>That which is willed; and farther question not."</l>

<l>Thereat were quieted the fleecy cheeks</l>
<l>Of him the ferryman of the livid fen,</l>
<l>Who round about his eyes had wheels of flame.</l>

<l>But all those souls who weary were and naked</l>
<l>Their colour changed and gnashed their teeth together,</l>
<l>As soon as they had heard those cruel words.</l>

<l>God they blasphemed and their progenitors,</l>
<l>The human race, the place, the time, the seed</l>
<l>Of their engendering and of their birth!</l>

<l>Thereafter all together they drew back,</l>
<l>Bitterly weeping, to the accursed shore,</l>
<l>Which waiteth every man who fears not God.</l>

<l>Charon the demon, with the eyes of glede,</l>
<l>Beckoning to them, collects them all together,</l>
<l>Beats with his oar whoever lags behind.</l>

<l>As in the autumn-time the leaves fall off,</l>
<l>First one and then another, till the branch</l>
<l>Unto the earth surrenders all its spoils;</l>

<l>In similar wise the evil seed of Adam</l>
<l>Throw themselves from that margin one by one,</l>
<l>At signals, as a bird unto its lure.</l>

<l>So they depart across the dusky wave,</l>
<l>And ere upon the other side they land,</l>
<l>Again on this side a new troop assembles.</l>

<l>"My son," the courteous Master said to me,</l>
<l>"All those who perish in the wrath of God</l>
<l>Here meet together out of every land;</l>

<l>And ready are they to pass o'er the river,</l>
<l>Because celestial Justice spurs them on,</l>
<l>So that their fear is turned into desire.</l>

<l>This way there never passes a good soul;</l>
<l>And hence if Charon doth complain of thee,</l>
<l>Well mayst thou know now what his speech imports."</l>

<l>This being finished, all the dusk champaign</l>
<l>Trembled so violently, that of that terror</l>
<l>The recollection bathes me still with sweat.</l>

<l>The land of tears gave forth a blast of wind,</l>
<l>And fulminated a vermilion light,</l>
<l>Which overmastered in me every sense,</l>

<l>And as a man whom sleep hath seized I fell.</l>

</canto>
<canto number="IV">

<l>Broke the deep lethargy within my head</l>
<l>A heavy thunder, so that I upstarted,</l>
<l>Like to a person who by force is wakened;</l>

<l>And round about I moved my rested eyes,</l>
<l>Uprisen erect, and steadfastly I gazed,</l>
<l>To recognise the place wherein I was.</l>

<l>True is it, that upon the verge I found me</l>
<l>Of the abysmal valley dolorous,</l>
<l>That gathers thunder of infinite ululations.</l>

<l>Obscure, profound it was, and nebulous,</l>
<l>So that by fixing on its depths my sight</l>
<l>Nothing whatever I discerned therein.</l>

<l>"Let us descend now into the blind world,"</l>
<l>Began the Poet, pallid utterly;</l>
<l>"I will be first, and thou shalt second be."</l>

<l>And I, who of his colour was aware,</l>
<l>Said: "How shall I come, if thou art afraid,</l>
<l>Who'rt wont to be a comfort to my fears?"</l>

<l>And he to me: "The anguish of the people</l>
<l>Who are below here in my face depicts</l>
<l>That pity which for terror thou hast taken.</l>

<l>Let us go on, for the long way impels us."</l>
<l>Thus he went in, and thus he made me enter</l>
<l>The foremost circle that surrounds the abyss.</l>

<l>There, as it seemed to me from listening,</l>
<l>Were lamentations none, but only sighs,</l>
<l>That tremble made the everlasting air.</l>

<l>And this arose from sorrow without torment,</l>
<l>Which the crowds had, that many were and great,</l>
<l>Of infants and of women and of men.</l>

<l>To me the Master good: "Thou dost not ask</l>
<l>What spirits these, which thou beholdest, are?</l>
<l>Now will I have thee know, ere thou go farther,</l>

<l>That they sinned not; and if they merit had,</l>
<l>'Tis not enough, because they had not baptism</l>
<l>Which is the portal of the Faith thou holdest;</l>

<l>And if they were before Christianity,</l>
<l>In the right manner they adored not God;</l>
<l>And among such as these am I myself.</l>

<l>For such defects, and not for other guilt,</l>
<l>Lost are we and are only so far punished,</l>
<l>That without hope we live on in desire."</l>

<l>Great grief seized on my heart when this I heard,</l>
<l>Because some people of much worthiness</l>
<l>I knew, who in that Limbo were suspended.</l>

<l>"Tell me, my Master, tell me, thou my Lord,"</l>
<l>Began I, with desire of being certain</l>
<l>Of that Faith which o'ercometh every error,</l>

<l>"Came any one by his own merit hence,</l>
<l>Or by another's, who was blessed thereafter?"</l>
<l>And he, who understood my covert speech,</l>

<l>Replied: "I was a novice in this state,</l>
<l>When I saw hither come a Mighty One,</l>
<l>With sign of victory incoronate.</l>

<l>Hence he drew forth the shade of the First Parent,</l>
<l>And that of his son Abel, and of Noah,</l>
<l>Of Moses the lawgiver, and the obedient</l>

<l>Abraham, patriarch, and David, king,</l>
<l>Israel with his father and his children,</l>
<l>And Rachel, for whose sake he did so much,</l>

<l>And others many, and he made them blessed;</l>
<l>And thou must know, that earlier than these</l>
<l>Never were any human spirits saved."</l>

<l>We ceased not to advance because he spake,</l>
<l>But still were passing onward through the forest,</l>
<l>The forest, say I, of thick-crowded ghosts.</l>

<l>Not very far as yet our way had gone</l>
<l>This side the summit, when I saw a fire</l>
<l>That overcame a hemisphere of darkness.</l>

<l>We were a little distant from it still,</l>
<l>But not so far that I in part discerned not</l>
<l>That honourable people held that place.</l>

<l>"O thou who honourest every art and science,</l>
<l>Who may these be, which such great honour have,</l>
<l>That from the fashion of the rest it parts them?"</l>

<l>And he to me: "The honourable name,</l>
<l>That sounds of them above there in thy life,</l>
<l>Wins grace in Heaven, that so advances them."</l>

<l>In the mean time a voice was heard by me:</l>
<l>"All honour be to the pre-eminent Poet;</l>
<l>His shade returns again, that was departed."</l>

<l>After the voice had ceased and quiet was,</l>
<l>Four mighty shades I saw approaching us;</l>
<l>Semblance had they nor sorrowful nor glad.</l>

<l>To say to me began my gracious Master:</l>
<l>"Him with that falchion in his hand behold,</l>
<l>Who comes before the three, even as their lord.</l>

<l>That one is Homer, Poet sovereign;</l>
<l>He who comes next is Horace, the satirist;</l>
<l>The third is Ovid, and the last is Lucan.</l>

<l>Because to each of these with me applies</l>
<l>The name that solitary voice proclaimed,</l>
<l>They do me honour, and in that do well."</l>

<l>Thus I beheld assemble the fair school</l>
<l>Of that lord of the song pre-eminent,</l>
<l>Who o'er the others like an eagle soars.</l>

<l>When they together had discoursed somewhat,</l>
<l>They turned to me with signs of salutation,</l>
<l>And on beholding this, my Master smiled;</l>

<l>And more of honour still, much more, they did me,</l>
<l>In that they made me one of their own band;</l>
<l>So that the sixth was I, 'mid so much wit.</l>

<l>Thus we went on as far as to the light,</l>
<l>Things saying 'tis becoming to keep silent,</l>
<l>As was the saying of them where I was.</l>

<l>We came unto a noble castle's foot,</l>
<l>Seven times encompassed with lofty walls,</l>
<l>Defended round by a fair rivulet;</l>

<l>This we passed over even as firm ground;</l>
<l>Through portals seven I entered with these Sages;</l>
<l>We came into a meadow of fresh verdure.</l>

<l>People were there with solemn eyes and slow,</l>
<l>Of great authority in their countenance;</l>
<l>They spake but seldom, and with gentle voices.</l>

<l>Thus we withdrew ourselves upon one side</l>
<l>Into an opening luminous and lofty,</l>
<l>So that they all of them were visible.</l>

<l>There opposite, upon the green enamel,</l>
<l>Were pointed out to me the mighty spirits,</l>
<l>Whom to have seen I feel myself exalted.</l>

<l>I saw Electra with companions many,</l>
<l>'Mongst whom I knew both Hector and Aeneas,</l>
<l>Caesar in armour with gerfalcon eyes;</l>

<l>I saw Camilla and Penthesilea</l>
<l>On the other side, and saw the King Latinus,</l>
<l>Who with Lavinia his daughter sat;</l>

<l>I saw that Brutus who drove Tarquin forth,</l>
<l>Lucretia, Julia, Marcia, and Cornelia,</l>
<l>And saw alone, apart, the Saladin.</l>

<l>When I had lifted up my brows a little,</l>
<l>The Master I beheld of those who know,</l>
<l>Sit with his philosophic family.</l>

<l>All gaze upon him, and all do him honour.</l>
<l>There I beheld both Socrates and Plato,</l>
<l>Who nearer him before the others stand;</l>

<l>Democritus, who puts the world on chance,</l>
<l>Diogenes, Anaxagoras, and Thales,</l>
<l>Zeno, Empedocles, and Heraclitus;</l>

<l>Of qualities I saw the good collector,</l>
<l>Hight Dioscorides; and Orpheus saw I,</l>
<l>Tully and Livy, and moral Seneca,</l>

<l>Euclid, geometrician, and Ptolemy,</l>
<l>Galen, Hippocrates, and Avicenna,</l>
<l>Averroes, who the great Comment made.</l>

<l>I cannot all of them pourtray in full,</l>
<l>Because so drives me onward the long theme,</l>
<l>That many times the word comes short of fact.</l>

<l>The sixfold company in two divides;</l>
<l>Another way my sapient Guide conducts me</l>
<l>Forth from the quiet to the air that trembles;</l>

<l>And to a place I come where nothing shines.</l>

</canto>
<canto number="V">

<l>Thus I descended out of the first circle</l>
<l>Down to the second, that less space begirds,</l>
<l>And so much greater dole, that goads to wailing.</l>

<l>There standeth Minos horribly, and snarls;</l>
<l>Examines the transgressions at the entrance;</l>
<l>Judges, and sends according as he girds him.</l>

<l>I say, that when the spirit evil-born</l>
<l>Cometh before him, wholly it confesses;</l>
<l>And this discriminator of transgressions</l>

<l>Seeth what place in Hell is meet for it;</l>
<l>Girds himself with his tail as many times</l>
<l>As grades he wishes it should be thrust down.</l>

<l>Always before him many of them stand;</l>
<l>They go by turns each one unto the judgment;</l>
<l>They speak, and hear, and then are downward hurled.</l>

<l>"O thou, that to this dolorous hostelry</l>
<l>Comest," said Minos to me, when he saw me,</l>
<l>Leaving the practice of so great an office,</l>

<l>"Look how thou enterest, and in whom thou trustest;</l>
<l>Let not the portal's amplitude deceive thee."</l>
<l>And unto him my Guide: "Why criest thou too?</l>

<l>Do not impede his journey fate-ordained;</l>
<l>It is so willed there where is power to do</l>
<l>That which is willed; and ask no further question."</l>

<l>And now begin the dolesome notes to grow</l>
<l>Audible unto me; now am I come</l>
<l>There where much lamentation strikes upon me.</l>

<l>I came into a place mute of all light,</l>
<l>Which bellows as the sea does in a tempest,</l>
<l>If by opposing winds 't is combated.</l>

<l>The infernal hurricane that never rests</l>
<l>Hurtles the spirits onward in its rapine;</l>
<l>Whirling them round, and smiting, it molests them.</l>

<l>When they arrive before the precipice,</l>
<l>There are the shrieks, the plaints, and the laments,</l>
<l>There they blaspheme the puissance divine.</l>

<l>I understood that unto such a torment</l>
<l>The carnal malefactors were condemned,</l>
<l>Who reason subjugate to appetite.</l>

<l>And as the wings of starlings bear them on</l>
<l>In the cold season in large band and full,</l>
<l>So doth that blast the spirits maledict;</l>

<l>It hither, thither, downward, upward, drives them;</l>
<l>No hope doth comfort them for evermore,</l>
<l>Not of repose, but even of lesser pain.</l>

<l>And as the cranes go chanting forth their lays,</l>
<l>Making in air a long line of themselves,</l>
<l>So saw I coming, uttering lamentations,</l>

<l>Shadows borne onward by the aforesaid stress.</l>
<l>Whereupon said I: "Master, who are those</l>
<l>People, whom the black air so castigates?"</l>

<l>"The first of those, of whom intelligence</l>
<l>Thou fain wouldst have," then said he unto me,</l>
<l>"The empress was of many languages.</l>

<l>To sensual vices she was so abandoned,</l>
<l>That lustful she made licit in her law,</l>
<l>To remove the blame to which she had been led.</l>

<l>She is Semiramis, of whom we read</l>
<l>That she succeeded Ninus, and was his spouse;</l>
<l>She held the land which now the Sultan rules.</l>

<l>The next is she who killed herself for love,</l>
<l>And broke faith with the ashes of Sichaeus;</l>
<l>Then Cleopatra the voluptuous."</l>

<l>Helen I saw, for whom so many ruthless</l>
<l>Seasons revolved; and saw the great Achilles,</l>
<l>Who at the last hour combated with Love.</l>

<l>Paris I saw, Tristan; and more than a thousand</l>
<l>Shades did he name and point out with his finger,</l>
<l>Whom Love had separated from our life.</l>

<l>After that I had listened to my Teacher,</l>
<l>Naming the dames of eld and cavaliers,</l>
<l>Pity prevailed, and I was nigh bewildered.</l>

<l>And I began: "O Poet, willingly</l>
<l>Speak would I to those two, who go together,</l>
<l>And seem upon the wind to be so light."</l>

<l>And, he to me: "Thou'lt mark, when they shall be</l>
<l>Nearer to us; and then do thou implore them</l>
<l>By love which leadeth them, and they will come."</l>

<l>Soon as the wind in our direction sways them,</l>
<l>My voice uplift I: "O ye weary souls!</l>
<l>Come speak to us, if no one interdicts it."</l>

<l>As turtle-doves, called onward by desire,</l>
<l>With open and steady wings to the sweet nest</l>
<l>Fly through the air by their volition borne,</l>

<l>So came they from the band where Dido is,</l>
<l>Approaching us athwart the air malign,</l>
<l>So strong was the affectionate appeal.</l>

<l>"O living creature gracious and benignant,</l>
<l>Who visiting goest through the purple air</l>
<l>Us, who have stained the world incarnadine,</l>

<l>If were the King of the Universe our friend,</l>
<l>We would pray unto him to give thee peace,</l>
<l>Since thou hast pity on our woe perverse.</l>

<l>Of what it pleases thee to hear and speak,</l>
<l>That will we hear, and we will speak to you,</l>
<l>While silent is the wind, as it is now.</l>

<l>Sitteth the city, wherein I was born,</l>
<l>Upon the sea-shore where the Po descends</l>
<l>To rest in peace with all his retinue.</l>

<l>Love, that on gentle heart doth swiftly seize,</l>
<l>Seized this man for the person beautiful</l>
<l>That was ta'en from me, and still the mode offends me.</l>

<l>Love, that exempts no one beloved from loving,</l>
<l>Seized me with pleasure of this man so strongly,</l>
<l>That, as thou seest, it doth not yet desert me;</l>

<l>Love has conducted us unto one death;</l>
<l>Caina waiteth him who quenched our life!"</l>
<l>These words were borne along from them to us.</l>

<l>As soon as I had heard those souls tormented,</l>
<l>I bowed my face, and so long held it down</l>
<l>Until the Poet said to me: "What thinkest?"</l>

<l>When I made answer, I began: "Alas!</l>
<l>How many pleasant thoughts, how much desire,</l>
<l>Conducted these unto the dolorous pass!"</l>

<l>Then unto them I turned me, and I spake,</l>
<l>And I began: "Thine agonies, Francesca,</l>
<l>Sad and compassionate to weeping make me.</l>

<l>But tell me, at the time of those sweet sighs,</l>
<l>By what and in what manner Love conceded,</l>
<l>That you should know your dubious desires?"</l>

<l>And she to me: "There is no greater sorrow</l>
<l>Than to be mindful of the happy time</l>
<l>In misery, and that thy Teacher knows.</l>

<l>But, if to recognise the earliest root</l>
<l>Of love in us thou hast so great desire,</l>
<l>I will do even as he who weeps and speaks.</l>

<l>One day we reading were for our delight</l>
<l>Of Launcelot, how Love did him enthral.</l>
<l>Alone we were and without any fear.</l>

<l>Full many a time our eyes together drew</l>
<l>That reading, and drove the colour from our faces;</l>
<l>But one point only was it that o'ercame us.</l>

<l>When as we read of the much-longed-for smile</l>
<l>Being by such a noble lover kissed,</l>
<l>This one, who ne'er from me shall be divided,</l>

<l>Kissed me upon the mouth all palpitating.</l>
<l>Galeotto was the book and he who wrote it.</l>
<l>That day no farther did we read therein."</l>

<l>And all the while one spirit uttered this,</l>
<l>The other one did weep so, that, for pity,</l>
<l>I swooned away as if I had been dying,</l>

<l>And fell, even as a dead body falls.</l>

</canto>
<canto number="VI">

<l>At the return of consciousness, that closed</l>
<l>Before the pity of those two relations,</l>
<l>Which utterly with sadness had confused me,</l>

<l>New torments I behold, and new tormented</l>
<l>Around me, whichsoever way I move,</l>
<l>And whichsoever way I turn, and gaze.</l>

<l>In the third circle am I of the rain</l>
<l>Eternal, maledict, and cold, and heavy;</l>
<l>Its law and quality are never new.</l>

<l>Huge hail, and water sombre-hued, and snow,</l>
<l>Athwart the tenebrous air pour down amain;</l>
<l>Noisome the earth is, that receiveth this.</l>

<l>Cerberus, monster cruel and uncouth,</l>
<l>With his three gullets like a dog is barking</l>
<l>Over the people that are there submerged.</l>

<l>Red eyes he has, and unctuous beard and black,</l>
<l>And belly large, and armed with claws his hands;</l>
<l>He rends the spirits, flays, and quarters them.</l>

<l>Howl the rain maketh them like unto dogs;</l>
<l>One side they make a shelter for the other;</l>
<l>Oft turn themselves the wretched reprobates.</l>

<l>When Cerberus perceived us, the great worm!</l>
<l>His mouths he opened, and displayed his tusks;</l>
<l>Not a limb had he that was motionless.</l>

<l>And my Conductor, with his spans extended,</l>
<l>Took of the earth, and with his fists well filled,</l>
<l>He threw it into those rapacious gullets.</l>

<l>Such as that dog is, who by barking craves,</l>
<l>And quiet grows soon as his food he gnaws,</l>
<l>For to devour it he but thinks and struggles,</l>

<l>The like became those muzzles filth-begrimed</l>
<l>Of Cerberus the demon, who so thunders</l>
<l>Over the souls that they would fain be deaf.</l>

<l>We passed across the shadows, which subdues</l>
<l>The heavy rain-storm, and we placed our feet</l>
<l>Upon their vanity that person seems.</l>

<l>They all were lying prone upon the earth,</l>
<l>Excepting one, who sat upright as soon</l>
<l>As he beheld us passing on before him.</l>

<l>"O thou that art conducted through this Hell,"</l>
<l>He said to me, "recall me, if thou canst;</l>
<l>Thyself wast made before I was unmade."</l>

<l>And I to him: "The anguish which thou hast</l>
<l>Perhaps doth draw thee out of my remembrance,</l>
<l>So that it seems not I have ever seen thee.</l>

<l>But tell me who thou art, that in so doleful</l>
<l>A place art put, and in such punishment,</l>
<l>If some are greater, none is so displeasing."</l>

<l>And he to me: "Thy city, which is full</l>
<l>Of envy so that now the sack runs over,</l>
<l>Held me within it in the life serene.</l>

<l>You citizens were wont to call me Ciacco;</l>
<l>For the pernicious sin of gluttony</l>
<l>I, as thou seest, am battered by this rain.</l>

<l>And I, sad soul, am not the only one,</l>
<l>For all these suffer the like penalty</l>
<l>For the like sin;" and word no more spake he.</l>

<l>I answered him: "Ciacco, thy wretchedness</l>
<l>Weighs on me so that it to weep invites me;</l>
<l>But tell me, if thou knowest, to what shall come</l>

<l>The citizens of the divided city;</l>
<l>If any there be just; and the occasion</l>
<l>Tell me why so much discord has assailed it."</l>

<l>And he to me: "They, after long contention,</l>
<l>Will come to bloodshed; and the rustic party</l>
<l>Will drive the other out with much offence.</l>

<l>Then afterwards behoves it this one fall</l>
<l>Within three suns, and rise again the other</l>
<l>By force of him who now is on the coast.</l>

<l>High will it hold its forehead a long while,</l>
<l>Keeping the other under heavy burdens,</l>
<l>Howe'er it weeps thereat and is indignant.</l>

<l>The just are two, and are not understood there;</l>
<l>Envy and Arrogance and Avarice</l>
<l>Are the three sparks that have all hearts enkindled."</l>

<l>Here ended he his tearful utterance;</l>
<l>And I to him: "I wish thee still to teach me,</l>
<l>And make a gift to me of further speech.</l>

<l>Farinata and Tegghiaio, once so worthy,</l>
<l>Jacopo Rusticucci, Arrigo, and Mosca,</l>
<l>And others who on good deeds set their thoughts,</l>

<l>Say where they are, and cause that I may know them;</l>
<l>For great desire constraineth me to learn</l>
<l>If Heaven doth sweeten them, or Hell envenom."</l>

<l>And he: "They are among the blacker souls;</l>
<l>A different sin downweighs them to the bottom;</l>
<l>If thou so far descendest, thou canst see them.</l>

<l>But when thou art again in the sweet world,</l>
<l>I pray thee to the mind of others bring me;</l>
<l>No more I tell thee and no more I answer."</l>

<l>Then his straightforward eyes he turned askance,</l>
<l>Eyed me a little, and then bowed his head;</l>
<l>He fell therewith prone like the other blind.</l>

<l>And the Guide said to me: "He wakes no more</l>
<l>This side the sound of the angelic trumpet;</l>
<l>When shall approach the hostile Potentate,</l>

<l>Each one shall find again his dismal tomb,</l>
<l>Shall reassume his flesh and his own figure,</l>
<l>Shall hear what through eternity re-echoes."</l>

<l>So we passed onward o'er the filthy mixture</l>
<l>Of shadows and of rain with footsteps slow,</l>
<l>Touching a little on the future life.</l>

<l>Wherefore I said: "Master, these torments here,</l>
<l>Will they increase after the mighty sentence,</l>
<l>Or lesser be, or will they be as burning?"</l>

<l>And he to me: "Return unto thy science,</l>
<l>Which wills, that as the thing more perfect is,</l>
<l>The more it feels of pleasure and of pain.</l>

<l>Albeit that this people maledict</l>
<l>To true perfection never can attain,</l>
<l>Hereafter more than now they look to be."</l>

<l>Round in a circle by that road we went,</l>
<l>Speaking much more, which I do not repeat;</l>
<l>We came unto the point where the descent is;</l>

<l>There we found Plutus the great enemy.</l>

</canto>
<canto number="VII">

<l>"Pape Satan, Pape Satan, Aleppe!"</l>
<l>Thus Plutus with his clucking voice began;</l>
<l>And that benignant Sage, who all things knew,</l>

<l>Said, to encourage me: "Let not thy fear</l>
<l>Harm thee; for any power that he may have</l>
<l>Shall not prevent thy going down this crag."</l>

<l>Then he turned round unto that bloated lip,</l>
<l>And said: "Be silent, thou accursed wolf;</l>
<l>Consume within thyself with thine own rage.</l>

<l>Not causeless is this journey to the abyss;</l>
<l>Thus is it willed on high, where Michael wrought</l>
<l>Vengeance upon the proud adultery."</l>

<l>Even as the sails inflated by the wind</l>
<l>Involved together fall when snaps the mast,</l>
<l>So fell the cruel monster to the earth.</l>

<l>Thus we descended into the fourth chasm,</l>
<l>Gaining still farther on the dolesome shore</l>
<l>Which all the woe of the universe insacks.</l>

<l>Justice of God, ah! who heaps up so many</l>
<l>New toils and sufferings as I beheld?</l>
<l>And why doth our transgression waste us so?</l>

<l>As doth the billow there upon Charybdis,</l>
<l>That breaks itself on that which it encounters,</l>
<l>So here the folk must dance their roundelay.</l>

<l>Here saw I people, more than elsewhere, many,</l>
<l>On one side and the other, with great howls,</l>
<l>Rolling weights forward by main force of chest.</l>

<l>They clashed together, and then at that point</l>
<l>Each one turned backward, rolling retrograde,</l>
<l>Crying, "Why keepest?" and, "Why squanderest thou?"</l>

<l>Thus they returned along the lurid circle</l>
<l>On either hand unto the opposite point,</l>
<l>Shouting their shameful metre evermore.</l>

<l>Then each, when he arrived there, wheeled about</l>
<l>Through his half-circle to another joust;</l>
<l>And I, who had my heart pierced as it were,</l>

<l>Exclaimed: "My Master, now declare to me</l>
<l>What people these are, and if all were clerks,</l>
<l>These shaven crowns upon the left of us."</l>

<l>And he to me: "All of them were asquint</l>
<l>In intellect in the first life, so much</l>
<l>That there with measure they no spending made.</l>

<l>Clearly enough their voices bark it forth,</l>
<l>Whene'er they reach the two points of the circle,</l>
<l>Where sunders them the opposite defect.</l>

<l>Clerks those were who no hairy covering</l>
<l>Have on the head, and Popes and Cardinals,</l>
<l>In whom doth Avarice practise its excess."</l>

<l>And I: "My Master, among such as these</l>
<l>I ought forsooth to recognise some few,</l>
<l>Who were infected with these maladies."</l>

<l>And he to me: "Vain thought thou entertainest;</l>
<l>The undiscerning life which made them sordid</l>
<l>Now makes them unto all discernment dim.</l>

<l>Forever shall they come to these two buttings;</l>
<l>These from the sepulchre shall rise again</l>
<l>With the fist closed, and these with tresses shorn.</l>

<l>Ill giving and ill keeping the fair world</l>
<l>Have ta'en from them, and placed them in this scuffle;</l>
<l>Whate'er it be, no words adorn I for it.</l>

<l>Now canst thou, Son, behold the transient farce</l>
<l>Of goods that are committed unto Fortune,</l>
<l>For which the human race each other buffet;</l>

<l>For all the gold that is beneath the moon,</l>
<l>Or ever has been, of these weary souls</l>
<l>Could never make a single one repose."</l>

<l>"Master," I said to him, "now tell me also</l>
<l>What is this Fortune which thou speakest of,</l>
<l>That has the world's goods so within its clutches?"</l>

<l>And he to me: "O creatures imbecile,</l>
<l>What ignorance is this which doth beset you?</l>
<l>Now will I have thee learn my judgment of her.</l>

<l>He whose omniscience everything transcends</l>
<l>The heavens created, and gave who should guide them,</l>
<l>That every part to every part may shine,</l>

<l>Distributing the light in equal measure;</l>
<l>He in like manner to the mundane splendours</l>
<l>Ordained a general ministress and guide,</l>

<l>That she might change at times the empty treasures</l>
<l>From race to race, from one blood to another,</l>
<l>Beyond resistance of all human wisdom.</l>

<l>Therefore one people triumphs, and another</l>
<l>Languishes, in pursuance of her judgment,</l>
<l>Which hidden is, as in the grass a serpent.</l>

<l>Your knowledge has no counterstand against her;</l>
<l>She makes provision, judges, and pursues</l>
<l>Her governance, as theirs the other gods.</l>

<l>Her permutations have not any truce;</l>
<l>Necessity makes her precipitate,</l>
<l>So often cometh who his turn obtains.</l>

<l>And this is she who is so crucified</l>
<l>Even by those who ought to give her praise,</l>
<l>Giving her blame amiss, and bad repute.</l>

<l>But she is blissful, and she hears it not;</l>
<l>Among the other primal creatures gladsome</l>
<l>She turns her sphere, and blissful she rejoices.</l>

<l>Let us descend now unto greater woe;</l>
<l>Already sinks each star that was ascending</l>
<l>When I set out, and loitering is forbidden."</l>

<l>We crossed the circle to the other bank,</l>
<l>Near to a fount that boils, and pours itself</l>
<l>Along a gully that runs out of it.</l>

<l>The water was more sombre far than perse;</l>
<l>And we, in company with the dusky waves,</l>
<l>Made entrance downward by a path uncouth.</l>

<l>A marsh it makes, which has the name of Styx,</l>
<l>This tristful brooklet, when it has descended</l>
<l>Down to the foot of the malign gray shores.</l>

<l>And I, who stood intent upon beholding,</l>
<l>Saw people mud-besprent in that lagoon,</l>
<l>All of them naked and with angry look.</l>

<l>They smote each other not alone with hands,</l>
<l>But with the head and with the breast and feet,</l>
<l>Tearing each other piecemeal with their teeth.</l>

<l>Said the good Master: "Son, thou now beholdest</l>
<l>The souls of those whom anger overcame;</l>
<l>And likewise I would have thee know for certain</l>

<l>Beneath the water people are who sigh</l>
<l>And make this water bubble at the surface,</l>
<l>As the eye tells thee wheresoe'er it turns.</l>

<l>Fixed in the mire they say, 'We sullen were</l>
<l>In the sweet air, which by the sun is gladdened,</l>
<l>Bearing within ourselves the sluggish reek;</l>

<l>Now we are sullen in this sable mire.'</l>
<l>This hymn do they keep gurgling in their throats,</l>
<l>For with unbroken words they cannot say it."</l>

<l>Thus we went circling round the filthy fen</l>
<l>A great arc 'twixt the dry bank and the swamp,</l>
<l>With eyes turned unto those who gorge the mire;</l>

<l>Unto the foot of a tower we came at last.</l>

</canto>
<canto number="VIII">

<l>I say, continuing, that long before</l>
<l>We to the foot of that high tower had come,</l>
<l>Our eyes went upward to the summit of it,</l>

<l>By reason of two flamelets we saw placed there,</l>
<l>And from afar another answer them,</l>
<l>So far, that hardly could the eye attain it.</l>

<l>And, to the sea of all discernment turned,</l>
<l>I said: "What sayeth this, and what respondeth</l>
<l>That other fire? and who are they that made it?"</l>

<l>And he to me: "Across the turbid waves</l>
<l>What is expected thou canst now discern,</l>
<l>If reek of the morass conceal it not."</l>

<l>Cord never shot an arrow from itself</l>
<l>That sped away athwart the air so swift,</l>
<l>As I beheld a very little boat</l>

<l>Come o'er the water tow'rds us at that moment,</l>
<l>Under the guidance of a single pilot,</l>
<l>Who shouted, "Now art thou arrived, fell soul?"</l>

<l>"Phlegyas, Phlegyas, thou criest out in vain</l>
<l>For this once," said my Lord; "thou shalt not have us</l>
<l>Longer than in the passing of the slough."</l>

<l>As he who listens to some great deceit</l>
<l>That has been done to him, and then resents it,</l>
<l>Such became Phlegyas, in his gathered wrath.</l>

<l>My Guide descended down into the boat,</l>
<l>And then he made me enter after him,</l>
<l>And only when I entered seemed it laden.</l>

<l>Soon as the Guide and I were in the boat,</l>
<l>The antique prow goes on its way, dividing</l>
<l>More of the water than 'tis wont with others.</l>

<l>While we were running through the dead canal,</l>
<l>Uprose in front of me one full of mire,</l>
<l>And said, "Who 'rt thou that comest ere the hour?"</l>

<l>And I to him: "Although I come, I stay not;</l>
<l>But who art thou that hast become so squalid?"</l>
<l>"Thou seest that I am one who weeps," he answered.</l>

<l>And I to him: "With weeping and with wailing,</l>
<l>Thou spirit maledict, do thou remain;</l>
<l>For thee I know, though thou art all defiled."</l>

<l>Then stretched he both his hands unto the boat;</l>
<l>Whereat my wary Master thrust him back,</l>
<l>Saying, "Away there with the other dogs!"</l>

<l>Thereafter with his arms he clasped my neck;</l>
<l>He kissed my face, and said: "Disdainful soul,</l>
<l>Blessed be she who bore thee in her bosom.</l>

<l>That was an arrogant person in the world;</l>
<l>Goodness is none, that decks his memory;</l>
<l>So likewise here his shade is furious.</l>

<l>How many are esteemed great kings up there,</l>
<l>Who here shall be like unto swine in mire,</l>
<l>Leaving behind them horrible dispraises!"</l>

<l>And I: "My Master, much should I be pleased,</l>
<l>If I could see him soused into this broth,</l>
<l>Before we issue forth out of the lake."</l>

<l>And he to me: "Ere unto thee the shore</l>
<l>Reveal itself, thou shalt be satisfied;</l>
<l>Such a desire 'tis meet thou shouldst enjoy."</l>

<l>A little after that, I saw such havoc</l>
<l>Made of him by the people of the mire,</l>
<l>That still I praise and thank my God for it.</l>

<l>They all were shouting, "At Philippo Argenti!"</l>
<l>And that exasperate spirit Florentine</l>
<l>Turned round upon himself with his own teeth.</l>

<l>We left him there, and more of him I tell not;</l>
<l>But on mine ears there smote a lamentation,</l>
<l>Whence forward I intent unbar mine eyes.</l>

<l>And the good Master said: "Even now, my Son,</l>
<l>The city draweth near whose name is Dis,</l>
<l>With the grave citizens, with the great throng."</l>

<l>And I: "Its mosques already, Master, clearly</l>
<l>Within there in the valley I discern</l>
<l>Vermilion, as if issuing from the fire</l>

<l>They were."  And he to me: "The fire eternal</l>
<l>That kindles them within makes them look red,</l>
<l>As thou beholdest in this nether Hell."</l>

<l>Then we arrived within the moats profound,</l>
<l>That circumvallate that disconsolate city;</l>
<l>The walls appeared to me to be of iron.</l>

<l>Not without making first a circuit wide,</l>
<l>We came unto a place where loud the pilot</l>
<l>Cried out to us, "Debark, here is the entrance."</l>

<l>More than a thousand at the gates I saw</l>
<l>Out of the Heavens rained down, who angrily</l>
<l>Were saying, "Who is this that without death</l>

<l>Goes through the kingdom of the people dead?"</l>
<l>And my sagacious Master made a sign</l>
<l>Of wishing secretly to speak with them.</l>

<l>A little then they quelled their great disdain,</l>
<l>And said: "Come thou alone, and he begone</l>
<l>Who has so boldly entered these dominions.</l>

<l>Let him return alone by his mad road;</l>
<l>Try, if he can; for thou shalt here remain,</l>
<l>Who hast escorted him through such dark regions."</l>

<l>Think, Reader, if I was discomforted</l>
<l>At utterance of the accursed words;</l>
<l>For never to return here I believed.</l>

<l>"O my dear Guide, who more than seven times</l>
<l>Hast rendered me security, and drawn me</l>
<l>From imminent peril that before me stood,</l>

<l>Do not desert me," said I, "thus undone;</l>
<l>And if the going farther be denied us,</l>
<l>Let us retrace our steps together swiftly."</l>

<l>And that Lord, who had led me thitherward,</l>
<l>Said unto me: "Fear not; because our passage</l>
<l>None can take from us, it by Such is given.</l>

<l>But here await me, and thy weary spirit</l>
<l>Comfort and nourish with a better hope;</l>
<l>For in this nether world I will not leave thee."</l>

<l>So onward goes and there abandons me</l>
<l>My Father sweet, and I remain in doubt,</l>
<l>For No and Yes within my head contend.</l>

<l>I could not hear what he proposed to them;</l>
<l>But with them there he did not linger long,</l>
<l>Ere each within in rivalry ran back.</l>

<l>They closed the portals, those our adversaries,</l>
<l>On my Lord's breast, who had remained without</l>
<l>And turned to me with footsteps far between.</l>

<l>His eyes cast down, his forehead shorn had he</l>
<l>Of all its boldness, and he said, with sighs,</l>
<l>"Who has denied to me the dolesome houses?"</l>

<l>And unto me: "Thou, because I am angry,</l>
<l>Fear not, for I will conquer in the trial,</l>
<l>Whatever for defence within be planned.</l>

<l>This arrogance of theirs is nothing new;</l>
<l>For once they used it at less secret gate,</l>
<l>Which finds itself without a fastening still.</l>

<l>O'er it didst thou behold the dead inscription;</l>
<l>And now this side of it descends the steep,</l>
<l>Passing across the circles without escort,</l>

<l>One by whose means the city shall be opened."</l>

</canto>
<canto number="IX">

<l>That hue which cowardice brought out on me,</l>
<l>Beholding my Conductor backward turn,</l>
<l>Sooner repressed within him his new colour.</l>

<l>He stopped attentive, like a man who listens,</l>
<l>Because the eye could not conduct him far</l>
<l>Through the black air, and through the heavy fog.</l>

<l>"Still it behoveth us to win the fight,"</l>
<l>Began he; "Else. . .Such offered us herself. . .</l>
<l>O how I long that some one here arrive!"</l>

<l>Well I perceived, as soon as the beginning</l>
<l>He covered up with what came afterward,</l>
<l>That they were words quite different from the first;</l>

<l>But none the less his saying gave me fear,</l>
<l>Because I carried out the broken phrase,</l>
<l>Perhaps to a worse meaning than he had.</l>

<l>"Into this bottom of the doleful conch</l>
<l>Doth any e'er descend from the first grade,</l>
<l>Which for its pain has only hope cut off?"</l>

<l>This question put I; and he answered me:</l>
<l>"Seldom it comes to pass that one of us</l>
<l>Maketh the journey upon which I go.</l>

<l>True is it, once before I here below</l>
<l>Was conjured by that pitiless Erictho,</l>
<l>Who summoned back the shades unto their bodies.</l>

<l>Naked of me short while the flesh had been,</l>
<l>Before within that wall she made me enter,</l>
<l>To bring a spirit from the circle of Judas;</l>

<l>That is the lowest region and the darkest,</l>
<l>And farthest from the heaven which circles all.</l>
<l>Well know I the way; therefore be reassured.</l>

<l>This fen, which a prodigious stench exhales,</l>
<l>Encompasses about the city dolent,</l>
<l>Where now we cannot enter without anger."</l>

<l>And more he said, but not in mind I have it;</l>
<l>Because mine eye had altogether drawn me</l>
<l>Tow'rds the high tower with the red-flaming summit,</l>

<l>Where in a moment saw I swift uprisen</l>
<l>The three infernal Furies stained with blood,</l>
<l>Who had the limbs of women and their mien,</l>

<l>And with the greenest hydras were begirt;</l>
<l>Small serpents and cerastes were their tresses,</l>
<l>Wherewith their horrid temples were entwined.</l>

<l>And he who well the handmaids of the Queen</l>
<l>Of everlasting lamentation knew,</l>
<l>Said unto me: "Behold the fierce Erinnys.</l>

<l>This is Megaera, on the left-hand side;</l>
<l>She who is weeping on the right, Alecto;</l>
<l>Tisiphone is between;" and then was silent.</l>

<l>Each one her breast was rending with her nails;</l>
<l>They beat them with their palms, and cried so loud,</l>
<l>That I for dread pressed close unto the Poet.</l>

<l>"Medusa come, so we to stone will change him!"</l>
<l>All shouted looking down; "in evil hour</l>
<l>Avenged we not on Theseus his assault!"</l>

<l>"Turn thyself round, and keep thine eyes close shut,</l>
<l>For if the Gorgon appear, and thou shouldst see it,</l>
<l>No more returning upward would there be."</l>

<l>Thus said the Master; and he turned me round</l>
<l>Himself, and trusted not unto my hands</l>
<l>So far as not to blind me with his own.</l>

<l>O ye who have undistempered intellects,</l>
<l>Observe the doctrine that conceals itself</l>
<l>Beneath the veil of the mysterious verses!</l>

<l>And now there came across the turbid waves</l>
<l>The clangour of a sound with terror fraught,</l>
<l>Because of which both of the margins trembled;</l>

<l>Not otherwise it was than of a wind</l>
<l>Impetuous on account of adverse heats,</l>
<l>That smites the forest, and, without restraint,</l>

<l>The branches rends, beats down, and bears away;</l>
<l>Right onward, laden with dust, it goes superb,</l>
<l>And puts to flight the wild beasts and the shepherds.</l>

<l>Mine eyes he loosed, and said: "Direct the nerve</l>
<l>Of vision now along that ancient foam,</l>
<l>There yonder where that smoke is most intense."</l>

<l>Even as the frogs before the hostile serpent</l>
<l>Across the water scatter all abroad,</l>
<l>Until each one is huddled in the earth.</l>

<l>More than a thousand ruined souls I saw,</l>
<l>Thus fleeing from before one who on foot</l>
<l>Was passing o'er the Styx with soles unwet.</l>

<l>From off his face he fanned that unctuous air,</l>
<l>Waving his left hand oft in front of him,</l>
<l>And only with that anguish seemed he weary.</l>

<l>Well I perceived one sent from Heaven was he,</l>
<l>And to the Master turned; and he made sign</l>
<l>That I should quiet stand, and bow before him.</l>

<l>Ah! how disdainful he appeared to me!</l>
<l>He reached the gate, and with a little rod</l>
<l>He opened it, for there was no resistance.</l>

<l>"O banished out of Heaven, people despised!"</l>
<l>Thus he began upon the horrid threshold;</l>
<l>"Whence is this arrogance within you couched?</l>

<l>Wherefore recalcitrate against that will,</l>
<l>From which the end can never be cut off,</l>
<l>And which has many times increased your pain?</l>

<l>What helpeth it to butt against the fates?</l>
<l>Your Cerberus, if you remember well,</l>
<l>For that still bears his chin and gullet peeled."</l>

<l>Then he returned along the miry road,</l>
<l>And spake no word to us, but had the look</l>
<l>Of one whom other care constrains and goads</l>

<l>Than that of him who in his presence is;</l>
<l>And we our feet directed tow'rds the city,</l>
<l>After those holy words all confident.</l>

<l>Within we entered without any contest;</l>
<l>And I, who inclination had to see</l>
<l>What the condition such a fortress holds,</l>

<l>Soon as I was within, cast round mine eye,</l>
<l>And see on every hand an ample plain,</l>
<l>Full of distress and torment terrible.</l>

<l>Even as at Arles, where stagnant grows the Rhone,</l>
<l>Even as at Pola near to the Quarnaro,</l>
<l>That shuts in Italy and bathes its borders,</l>

<l>The sepulchres make all the place uneven;</l>
<l>So likewise did they there on every side,</l>
<l>Saving that there the manner was more bitter;</l>

<l>For flames between the sepulchres were scattered,</l>
<l>By which they so intensely heated were,</l>
<l>That iron more so asks not any art.</l>

<l>All of their coverings uplifted were,</l>
<l>And from them issued forth such dire laments,</l>
<l>Sooth seemed they of the wretched and tormented.</l>

<l>And I: "My Master, what are all those people</l>
<l>Who, having sepulture within those tombs,</l>
<l>Make themselves audible by doleful sighs?"</l>

<l>And he to me: "Here are the Heresiarchs,</l>
<l>With their disciples of all sects, and much</l>
<l>More than thou thinkest laden are the tombs.</l>

<l>Here like together with its like is buried;</l>
<l>And more and less the monuments are heated."</l>
<l>And when he to the right had turned, we passed</l>

<l>Between the torments and high parapets.</l>

</canto>
<canto number="X">

<l>Now onward goes, along a narrow path</l>
<l>Between the torments and the city wall,</l>
<l>My Master, and I follow at his back.</l>

<l>"O power supreme, that through these impious circles</l>
<l>Turnest me," I began, "as pleases thee,</l>
<l>Speak to me, and my longings satisfy;</l>

<l>The people who are lying in these tombs,</l>
<l>Might they be seen? already are uplifted</l>
<l>The covers all, and no one keepeth guard."</l>

<l>And he to me: "They all will be closed up</l>
<l>When from Jehoshaphat they shall return</l>
<l>Here with the bodies they have left above.</l>

<l>Their cemetery have upon this side</l>
<l>With Epicurus all his followers,</l>
<l>Who with the body mortal make the soul;</l>

<l>But in the question thou dost put to me,</l>
<l>Within here shalt thou soon be satisfied,</l>
<l>And likewise in the wish thou keepest silent."</l>

<l>And I: "Good Leader, I but keep concealed</l>
<l>From thee my heart, that I may speak the less,</l>
<l>Nor only now hast thou thereto disposed me."</l>

<l>"O Tuscan, thou who through the city of fire</l>
<l>Goest alive, thus speaking modestly,</l>
<l>Be pleased to stay thy footsteps in this place.</l>

<l>Thy mode of speaking makes thee manifest</l>
<l>A native of that noble fatherland,</l>
<l>To which perhaps I too molestful was."</l>

<l>Upon a sudden issued forth this sound</l>
<l>From out one of the tombs; wherefore I pressed,</l>
<l>Fearing, a little nearer to my Leader.</l>

<l>And unto me he said: "Turn thee; what dost thou?</l>
<l>Behold there Farinata who has risen;</l>
<l>From the waist upwards wholly shalt thou see him."</l>

<l>I had already fixed mine eyes on his,</l>
<l>And he uprose erect with breast and front</l>
<l>E'en as if Hell he had in great despite.</l>

<l>And with courageous hands and prompt my Leader</l>
<l>Thrust me between the sepulchres towards him,</l>
<l>Exclaiming, "Let thy words explicit be."</l>

<l>As soon as I was at the foot of his tomb</l>
<l>Somewhat he eyed me, and, as if disdainful,</l>
<l>Then asked of me, "Who were thine ancestors?"</l>

<l>I, who desirous of obeying was,</l>
<l>Concealed it not, but all revealed to him;</l>
<l>Whereat he raised his brows a little upward.</l>

<l>Then said he: "Fiercely adverse have they been</l>
<l>To me, and to my fathers, and my party;</l>
<l>So that two several times I scattered them."</l>

<l>"If they were banished, they returned on all sides,"</l>
<l>I answered him, "the first time and the second;</l>
<l>But yours have not acquired that art aright."</l>

<l>Then there uprose upon the sight, uncovered</l>
<l>Down to the chin, a shadow at his side;</l>
<l>I think that he had risen on his knees.</l>

<l>Round me he gazed, as if solicitude</l>
<l>He had to see if some one else were with me,</l>
<l>But after his suspicion was all spent,</l>

<l>Weeping, he said to me: "If through this blind</l>
<l>Prison thou goest by loftiness of genius,</l>
<l>Where is my son? and why is he not with thee?"</l>

<l>And I to him: "I come not of myself;</l>
<l>He who is waiting yonder leads me here,</l>
<l>Whom in disdain perhaps your Guido had."</l>

<l>His language and the mode of punishment</l>
<l>Already unto me had read his name;</l>
<l>On that account my answer was so full.</l>

<l>Up starting suddenly, he cried out: "How</l>
<l>Saidst thou,--he had?  Is he not still alive?</l>
<l>Does not the sweet light strike upon his eyes?"</l>

<l>When he became aware of some delay,</l>
<l>Which I before my answer made, supine</l>
<l>He fell again, and forth appeared no more.</l>

<l>But the other, magnanimous, at whose desire</l>
<l>I had remained, did not his aspect change,</l>
<l>Neither his neck he moved, nor bent his side.</l>

<l>"And if," continuing his first discourse,</l>
<l>"They have that art," he said, "not learned aright,</l>
<l>That more tormenteth me, than doth this bed.</l>

<l>But fifty times shall not rekindled be</l>
<l>The countenance of the Lady who reigns here,</l>
<l>Ere thou shalt know how heavy is that art;</l>

<l>And as thou wouldst to the sweet world return,</l>
<l>Say why that people is so pitiless</l>
<l>Against my race in each one of its laws?"</l>

<l>Whence I to him: "The slaughter and great carnage</l>
<l>Which have with crimson stained the Arbia, cause</l>
<l>Such orisons in our temple to be made."</l>

<l>After his head he with a sigh had shaken,</l>
<l>"There I was not alone," he said, "nor surely</l>
<l>Without a cause had with the others moved.</l>

<l>But there I was alone, where every one</l>
<l>Consented to the laying waste of Florence,</l>
<l>He who defended her with open face."</l>

<l>"Ah! so hereafter may your seed repose,"</l>
<l>I him entreated, "solve for me that knot,</l>
<l>Which has entangled my conceptions here.</l>

<l>It seems that you can see, if I hear rightly,</l>
<l>Beforehand whatsoe'er time brings with it,</l>
<l>And in the present have another mode."</l>

<l>"We see, like those who have imperfect sight,</l>
<l>The things," he said, "that distant are from us;</l>
<l>So much still shines on us the Sovereign Ruler.</l>

<l>When they draw near, or are, is wholly vain</l>
<l>Our intellect, and if none brings it to us,</l>
<l>Not anything know we of your human state.</l>

<l>Hence thou canst understand, that wholly dead</l>
<l>Will be our knowledge from the moment when</l>
<l>The portal of the future shall be closed."</l>

<l>Then I, as if compunctious for my fault,</l>
<l>Said: "Now, then, you will tell that fallen one,</l>
<l>That still his son is with the living joined.</l>

<l>And if just now, in answering, I was dumb,</l>
<l>Tell him I did it because I was thinking</l>
<l>Already of the error you have solved me."</l>

<l>And now my Master was recalling me,</l>
<l>Wherefore more eagerly I prayed the spirit</l>
<l>That he would tell me who was with him there.</l>

<l>He said: "With more than a thousand here I lie;</l>
<l>Within here is the second Frederick,</l>
<l>And the Cardinal, and of the rest I speak not."</l>

<l>Thereon he hid himself; and I towards</l>
<l>The ancient poet turned my steps, reflecting</l>
<l>Upon that saying, which seemed hostile to me.</l>

<l>He moved along; and afterward thus going,</l>
<l>He said to me, "Why art thou so bewildered?"</l>
<l>And I in his inquiry satisfied him.</l>

<l>"Let memory preserve what thou hast heard</l>
<l>Against thyself," that Sage commanded me,</l>
<l>"And now attend here;" and he raised his finger.</l>

<l>"When thou shalt be before the radiance sweet</l>
<l>Of her whose beauteous eyes all things behold,</l>
<l>From her thou'lt know the journey of thy life."</l>

<l>Unto the left hand then he turned his feet;</l>
<l>We left the wall, and went towards the middle,</l>
<l>Along a path that strikes into a valley,</l>

<l>Which even up there unpleasant made its stench.</l>

</canto>
<canto number="XI">

<l>Upon the margin of a lofty bank</l>
<l>Which great rocks broken in a circle made,</l>
<l>We came upon a still more cruel throng;</l>

<l>And there, by reason of the horrible</l>
<l>Excess of stench the deep abyss throws out,</l>
<l>We drew ourselves aside behind the cover</l>

<l>Of a great tomb, whereon I saw a writing,</l>
<l>Which said: "Pope Anastasius I hold,</l>
<l>Whom out of the right way Photinus drew."</l>

<l>"Slow it behoveth our descent to be,</l>
<l>So that the sense be first a little used</l>
<l>To the sad blast, and then we shall not heed it."</l>

<l>The Master thus; and unto him I said,</l>
<l>"Some compensation find, that the time pass not</l>
<l>Idly;" and he: "Thou seest I think of that.</l>

<l>My son, upon the inside of these rocks,"</l>
<l>Began he then to say, "are three small circles,</l>
<l>From grade to grade, like those which thou art leaving.</l>

<l>They all are full of spirits maledict;</l>
<l>But that hereafter sight alone suffice thee,</l>
<l>Hear how and wherefore they are in constraint.</l>

<l>Of every malice that wins hate in Heaven,</l>
<l>Injury is the end; and all such end</l>
<l>Either by force or fraud afflicteth others.</l>

<l>But because fraud is man's peculiar vice,</l>
<l>More it displeases God; and so stand lowest</l>
<l>The fraudulent, and greater dole assails them.</l>

<l>All the first circle of the Violent is;</l>
<l>But since force may be used against three persons,</l>
<l>In three rounds 'tis divided and constructed.</l>

<l>To God, to ourselves, and to our neighbour can we</l>
<l>Use force; I say on them and on their things,</l>
<l>As thou shalt hear with reason manifest.</l>

<l>A death by violence, and painful wounds,</l>
<l>Are to our neighbour given; and in his substance</l>
<l>Ruin, and arson, and injurious levies;</l>

<l>Whence homicides, and he who smites unjustly,</l>
<l>Marauders, and freebooters, the first round</l>
<l>Tormenteth all in companies diverse.</l>

<l>Man may lay violent hands upon himself</l>
<l>And his own goods; and therefore in the second</l>
<l>Round must perforce without avail repent</l>

<l>Whoever of your world deprives himself,</l>
<l>Who games, and dissipates his property,</l>
<l>And weepeth there, where he should jocund be.</l>

<l>Violence can be done the Deity,</l>
<l>In heart denying and blaspheming Him,</l>
<l>And by disdaining Nature and her bounty.</l>

<l>And for this reason doth the smallest round</l>
<l>Seal with its signet Sodom and Cahors,</l>
<l>And who, disdaining God, speaks from the heart.</l>

<l>Fraud, wherewithal is every conscience stung,</l>
<l>A man may practise upon him who trusts,</l>
<l>And him who doth no confidence imburse.</l>

<l>This latter mode, it would appear, dissevers</l>
<l>Only the bond of love which Nature makes;</l>
<l>Wherefore within the second circle nestle</l>

<l>Hypocrisy, flattery, and who deals in magic,</l>
<l>Falsification, theft, and simony,</l>
<l>Panders, and barrators, and the like filth.</l>

<l>By the other mode, forgotten is that love</l>
<l>Which Nature makes, and what is after added,</l>
<l>From which there is a special faith engendered.</l>

<l>Hence in the smallest circle, where the point is</l>
<l>Of the Universe, upon which Dis is seated,</l>
<l>Whoe'er betrays for ever is consumed."</l>

<l>And I: "My Master, clear enough proceeds</l>
<l>Thy reasoning, and full well distinguishes</l>
<l>This cavern and the people who possess it.</l>

<l>But tell me, those within the fat lagoon,</l>
<l>Whom the wind drives, and whom the rain doth beat,</l>
<l>And who encounter with such bitter tongues,</l>

<l>Wherefore are they inside of the red city</l>
<l>Not punished, if God has them in his wrath,</l>
<l>And if he has not, wherefore in such fashion?"</l>

<l>And unto me he said: "Why wanders so</l>
<l>Thine intellect from that which it is wont?</l>
<l>Or, sooth, thy mind where is it elsewhere looking?</l>

<l>Hast thou no recollection of those words</l>
<l>With which thine Ethics thoroughly discusses</l>
<l>The dispositions three, that Heaven abides not,--</l>

<l>Incontinence, and Malice, and insane</l>
<l>Bestiality? and how Incontinence</l>
<l>Less God offendeth, and less blame attracts?</l>

<l>If thou regardest this conclusion well,</l>
<l>And to thy mind recallest who they are</l>
<l>That up outside are undergoing penance,</l>

<l>Clearly wilt thou perceive why from these felons</l>
<l>They separated are, and why less wroth</l>
<l>Justice divine doth smite them with its hammer."</l>

<l>"O Sun, that healest all distempered vision,</l>
<l>Thou dost content me so, when thou resolvest,</l>
<l>That doubting pleases me no less than knowing!</l>

<l>Once more a little backward turn thee," said I,</l>
<l>"There where thou sayest that usury offends</l>
<l>Goodness divine, and disengage the knot."</l>

<l>"Philosophy," he said, "to him who heeds it,</l>
<l>Noteth, not only in one place alone,</l>
<l>After what manner Nature takes her course</l>

<l>From Intellect Divine, and from its art;</l>
<l>And if thy Physics carefully thou notest,</l>
<l>After not many pages shalt thou find,</l>

<l>That this your art as far as possible</l>
<l>Follows, as the disciple doth the master;</l>
<l>So that your art is, as it were, God's grandchild.</l>

<l>From these two, if thou bringest to thy mind</l>
<l>Genesis at the beginning, it behoves</l>
<l>Mankind to gain their life and to advance;</l>

<l>And since the usurer takes another way,</l>
<l>Nature herself and in her follower</l>
<l>Disdains he, for elsewhere he puts his hope.</l>

<l>But follow, now, as I would fain go on,</l>
<l>For quivering are the Fishes on the horizon,</l>
<l>And the Wain wholly over Caurus lies,</l>

<l>And far beyond there we descend the crag."</l>

</canto>
<canto number="XII">

<l>The place where to descend the bank we came</l>
<l>Was alpine, and from what was there, moreover,</l>
<l>Of such a kind that every eye would shun it.</l>

<l>Such as that ruin is which in the flank</l>
<l>Smote, on this side of Trent, the Adige,</l>
<l>Either by earthquake or by failing stay,</l>

<l>For from the mountain's top, from which it moved,</l>
<l>Unto the plain the cliff is shattered so,</l>
<l>Some path 'twould give to him who was above;</l>

<l>Even such was the descent of that ravine,</l>
<l>And on the border of the broken chasm</l>
<l>The infamy of Crete was stretched along,</l>

<l>Who was conceived in the fictitious cow;</l>
<l>And when he us beheld, he bit himself,</l>
<l>Even as one whom anger racks within.</l>

<l>My Sage towards him shouted: "Peradventure</l>
<l>Thou think'st that here may be the Duke of Athens,</l>
<l>Who in the world above brought death to thee?</l>

<l>Get thee gone, beast, for this one cometh not</l>
<l>Instructed by thy sister, but he comes</l>
<l>In order to behold your punishments."</l>

<l>As is that bull who breaks loose at the moment</l>
<l>In which he has received the mortal blow,</l>
<l>Who cannot walk, but staggers here and there,</l>

<l>The Minotaur beheld I do the like;</l>
<l>And he, the wary, cried: "Run to the passage;</l>
<l>While he wroth, 'tis well thou shouldst descend."</l>

<l>Thus down we took our way o'er that discharge</l>
<l>Of stones, which oftentimes did move themselves</l>
<l>Beneath my feet, from the unwonted burden.</l>

<l>Thoughtful I went; and he said: "Thou art thinking</l>
<l>Perhaps upon this ruin, which is guarded</l>
<l>By that brute anger which just now I quenched.</l>

<l>Now will I have thee know, the other time</l>
<l>I here descended to the nether Hell,</l>
<l>This precipice had not yet fallen down.</l>

<l>But truly, if I well discern, a little</l>
<l>Before His coming who the mighty spoil</l>
<l>Bore off from Dis, in the supernal circle,</l>

<l>Upon all sides the deep and loathsome valley</l>
<l>Trembled so, that I thought the Universe</l>
<l>Was thrilled with love, by which there are who think</l>

<l>The world ofttimes converted into chaos;</l>
<l>And at that moment this primeval crag</l>
<l>Both here and elsewhere made such overthrow.</l>

<l>But fix thine eyes below; for draweth near</l>
<l>The river of blood, within which boiling is</l>
<l>Whoe'er by violence doth injure others."</l>

<l>O blind cupidity, O wrath insane,</l>
<l>That spurs us onward so in our short life,</l>
<l>And in the eternal then so badly steeps us!</l>

<l>I saw an ample moat bent like a bow,</l>
<l>As one which all the plain encompasses,</l>
<l>Conformable to what my Guide had said.</l>

<l>And between this and the embankment's foot</l>
<l>Centaurs in file were running, armed with arrows,</l>
<l>As in the world they used the chase to follow.</l>

<l>Beholding us descend, each one stood still,</l>
<l>And from the squadron three detached themselves,</l>
<l>With bows and arrows in advance selected;</l>

<l>And from afar one cried: "Unto what torment</l>
<l>Come ye, who down the hillside are descending?</l>
<l>Tell us from there; if not, I draw the bow."</l>

<l>My Master said: "Our answer will we make</l>
<l>To Chiron, near you there; in evil hour,</l>
<l>That will of thine was evermore so hasty."</l>

<l>Then touched he me, and said: "This one is Nessus,</l>
<l>Who perished for the lovely Dejanira,</l>
<l>And for himself, himself did vengeance take.</l>

<l>And he in the midst, who at his breast is gazing,</l>
<l>Is the great Chiron, who brought up Achilles;</l>
<l>That other Pholus is, who was so wrathful.</l>

<l>Thousands and thousands go about the moat</l>
<l>Shooting with shafts whatever soul emerges</l>
<l>Out of the blood, more than his crime allots."</l>

<l>Near we approached unto those monsters fleet;</l>
<l>Chiron an arrow took, and with the notch</l>
<l>Backward upon his jaws he put his beard.</l>

<l>After he had uncovered his great mouth,</l>
<l>He said to his companions: "Are you ware</l>
<l>That he behind moveth whate'er he touches?</l>

<l>Thus are not wont to do the feet of dead men."</l>
<l>And my good Guide, who now was at his breast,</l>
<l>Where the two natures are together joined,</l>

<l>Replied: "Indeed he lives, and thus alone</l>
<l>Me it behoves to show him the dark valley;</l>
<l>Necessity, and not delight, impels us.</l>

<l>Some one withdrew from singing Halleluja,</l>
<l>Who unto me committed this new office;</l>
<l>No thief is he, nor I a thievish spirit.</l>

<l>But by that virtue through which I am moving</l>
<l>My steps along this savage thoroughfare,</l>
<l>Give us some one of thine, to be with us,</l>

<l>And who may show us where to pass the ford,</l>
<l>And who may carry this one on his back;</l>
<l>For 'tis no spirit that can walk the air."</l>

<l>Upon his right breast Chiron wheeled about,</l>
<l>And said to Nessus: "Turn and do thou guide them,</l>
<l>And warn aside, if other band may meet you."</l>

<l>We with our faithful escort onward moved</l>
<l>Along the brink of the vermilion boiling,</l>
<l>Wherein the boiled were uttering loud laments.</l>

<l>People I saw within up to the eyebrows,</l>
<l>And the great Centaur said: "Tyrants are these,</l>
<l>Who dealt in bloodshed and in pillaging.</l>

<l>Here they lament their pitiless mischiefs; here</l>
<l>Is Alexander, and fierce Dionysius</l>
<l>Who upon Sicily brought dolorous years.</l>

<l>That forehead there which has the hair so black</l>
<l>Is Azzolin; and the other who is blond,</l>
<l>Obizzo is of Esti, who, in truth,</l>

<l>Up in the world was by his stepson slain."</l>
<l>Then turned I to the Poet; and he said,</l>
<l>"Now he be first to thee, and second I."</l>

<l>A little farther on the Centaur stopped</l>
<l>Above a folk, who far down as the throat</l>
<l>Seemed from that boiling stream to issue forth.</l>

<l>A shade he showed us on one side alone,</l>
<l>Saying: "He cleft asunder in God's bosom</l>
<l>The heart that still upon the Thames is honoured."</l>

<l>Then people saw I, who from out the river</l>
<l>Lifted their heads and also all the chest;</l>
<l>And many among these I recognised.</l>

<l>Thus ever more and more grew shallower</l>
<l>That blood, so that the feet alone it covered;</l>
<l>And there across the moat our passage was.</l>

<l>"Even as thou here upon this side beholdest</l>
<l>The boiling stream, that aye diminishes,"</l>
<l>The Centaur said, "I wish thee to believe</l>

<l>That on this other more and more declines</l>
<l>Its bed, until it reunites itself</l>
<l>Where it behoveth tyranny to groan.</l>

<l>Justice divine, upon this side, is goading</l>
<l>That Attila, who was a scourge on earth,</l>
<l>And Pyrrhus, and Sextus; and for ever milks</l>

<l>The tears which with the boiling it unseals</l>
<l>In Rinier da Corneto and Rinier Pazzo,</l>
<l>Who made upon the highways so much war."</l>

<l>Then back he turned, and passed again the ford.</l>

</canto>
<canto number="XIII">

<l>Not yet had Nessus reached the other side,</l>
<l>When we had put ourselves within a wood,</l>
<l>That was not marked by any path whatever.</l>

<l>Not foliage green, but of a dusky colour,</l>
<l>Not branches smooth, but gnarled and intertangled,</l>
<l>Not apple-trees were there, but thorns with poison.</l>

<l>Such tangled thickets have not, nor so dense,</l>
<l>Those savage wild beasts, that in hatred hold</l>
<l>'Twixt Cecina and Corneto the tilled places.</l>

<l>There do the hideous Harpies make their nests,</l>
<l>Who chased the Trojans from the Strophades,</l>
<l>With sad announcement of impending doom;</l>

<l>Broad wings have they, and necks and faces human,</l>
<l>And feet with claws, and their great bellies fledged;</l>
<l>They make laments upon the wondrous trees.</l>

<l>And the good Master: "Ere thou enter farther,</l>
<l>Know that thou art within the second round,"</l>
<l>Thus he began to say, "and shalt be, till</l>

<l>Thou comest out upon the horrible sand;</l>
<l>Therefore look well around, and thou shalt see</l>
<l>Things that will credence give unto my speech."</l>

<l>I heard on all sides lamentations uttered,</l>
<l>And person none beheld I who might make them,</l>
<l>Whence, utterly bewildered, I stood still.</l>

<l>I think he thought that I perhaps might think</l>
<l>So many voices issued through those trunks</l>
<l>From people who concealed themselves from us;</l>

<l>Therefore the Master said: "If thou break off</l>
<l>Some little spray from any of these trees,</l>
<l>The thoughts thou hast will wholly be made vain."</l>

<l>Then stretched I forth my hand a little forward,</l>
<l>And plucked a branchlet off from a great thorn;</l>
<l>And the trunk cried, "Why dost thou mangle me?"</l>

<l>After it had become embrowned with blood,</l>
<l>It recommenced its cry: "Why dost thou rend me?</l>
<l>Hast thou no spirit of pity whatsoever?</l>

<l>Men once we were, and now are changed to trees;</l>
<l>Indeed, thy hand should be more pitiful,</l>
<l>Even if the souls of serpents we had been."</l>

<l>As out of a green brand, that is on fire</l>
<l>At one of the ends, and from the other drips</l>
<l>And hisses with the wind that is escaping;</l>

<l>So from that splinter issued forth together</l>
<l>Both words and blood; whereat I let the tip</l>
<l>Fall, and stood like a man who is afraid.</l>

<l>"Had he been able sooner to believe,"</l>
<l>My Sage made answer, "O thou wounded soul,</l>
<l>What only in my verses he has seen,</l>

<l>Not upon thee had he stretched forth his hand;</l>
<l>Whereas the thing incredible has caused me</l>
<l>To put him to an act which grieveth me.</l>

<l>But tell him who thou wast, so that by way</l>
<l>Of some amends thy fame he may refresh</l>
<l>Up in the world, to which he can return."</l>

<l>And the trunk said: "So thy sweet words allure me,</l>
<l>I cannot silent be; and you be vexed not,</l>
<l>That I a little to discourse am tempted.</l>

<l>I am the one who both keys had in keeping</l>
<l>Of Frederick's heart, and turned them to and fro</l>
<l>So softly in unlocking and in locking,</l>

<l>That from his secrets most men I withheld;</l>
<l>Fidelity I bore the glorious office</l>
<l>So great, I lost thereby my sleep and pulses.</l>

<l>The courtesan who never from the dwelling</l>
<l>Of Caesar turned aside her strumpet eyes,</l>
<l>Death universal and the vice of courts,</l>

<l>Inflamed against me all the other minds,</l>
<l>And they, inflamed, did so inflame Augustus,</l>
<l>That my glad honours turned to dismal mournings.</l>

<l>My spirit, in disdainful exultation,</l>
<l>Thinking by dying to escape disdain,</l>
<l>Made me unjust against myself, the just.</l>

<l>I, by the roots unwonted of this wood,</l>
<l>Do swear to you that never broke I faith</l>
<l>Unto my lord, who was so worthy of honour;</l>

<l>And to the world if one of you return,</l>
<l>Let him my memory comfort, which is lying</l>
<l>Still prostrate from the blow that envy dealt it."</l>

<l>Waited awhile, and then: "Since he is silent,"</l>
<l>The Poet said to me, "lose not the time,</l>
<l>But speak, and question him, if more may please thee."</l>

<l>Whence I to him: "Do thou again inquire</l>
<l>Concerning what thou thinks't will satisfy me;</l>
<l>For I cannot, such pity is in my heart."</l>

<l>Therefore he recommenced: "So may the man</l>
<l>Do for thee freely what thy speech implores,</l>
<l>Spirit incarcerate, again be pleased</l>

<l>To tell us in what way the soul is bound</l>
<l>Within these knots; and tell us, if thou canst,</l>
<l>If any from such members e'er is freed."</l>

<l>Then blew the trunk amain, and afterward</l>
<l>The wind was into such a voice converted:</l>
<l>"With brevity shall be replied to you.</l>

<l>When the exasperated soul abandons</l>
<l>The body whence it rent itself away,</l>
<l>Minos consigns it to the seventh abyss.</l>

<l>It falls into the forest, and no part</l>
<l>Is chosen for it; but where Fortune hurls it,</l>
<l>There like a grain of spelt it germinates.</l>

<l>It springs a sapling, and a forest tree;</l>
<l>The Harpies, feeding then upon its leaves,</l>
<l>Do pain create, and for the pain an outlet.</l>

<l>Like others for our spoils shall we return;</l>
<l>But not that any one may them revest,</l>
<l>For 'tis not just to have what one casts off.</l>

<l>Here we shall drag them, and along the dismal</l>
<l>Forest our bodies shall suspended be,</l>
<l>Each to the thorn of his molested shade."</l>

<l>We were attentive still unto the trunk,</l>
<l>Thinking that more it yet might wish to tell us,</l>
<l>When by a tumult we were overtaken,</l>

<l>In the same way as he is who perceives</l>
<l>The boar and chase approaching to his stand,</l>
<l>Who hears the crashing of the beasts and branches;</l>

<l>And two behold! upon our left-hand side,</l>
<l>Naked and scratched, fleeing so furiously,</l>
<l>That of the forest, every fan they broke.</l>

<l>He who was in advance: "Now help, Death, help!"</l>
<l>And the other one, who seemed to lag too much,</l>
<l>Was shouting: "Lano, were not so alert</l>

<l>Those legs of thine at joustings of the Toppo!"</l>
<l>And then, perchance because his breath was failing,</l>
<l>He grouped himself together with a bush.</l>

<l>Behind them was the forest full of black</l>
<l>She-mastiffs, ravenous, and swift of foot</l>
<l>As greyhounds, who are issuing from the chain.</l>

<l>On him who had crouched down they set their teeth,</l>
<l>And him they lacerated piece by piece,</l>
<l>Thereafter bore away those aching members.</l>

<l>Thereat my Escort took me by the hand,</l>
<l>And led me to the bush, that all in vain</l>
<l>Was weeping from its bloody lacerations.</l>

<l>"O Jacopo," it said, "of Sant' Andrea,</l>
<l>What helped it thee of me to make a screen?</l>
<l>What blame have I in thy nefarious life?"</l>

<l>When near him had the Master stayed his steps,</l>
<l>He said: "Who wast thou, that through wounds so many</l>
<l>Art blowing out with blood thy dolorous speech?"</l>

<l>And he to us: "O souls, that hither come</l>
<l>To look upon the shameful massacre</l>
<l>That has so rent away from me my leaves,</l>

<l>Gather them up beneath the dismal bush;</l>
<l>I of that city was which to the Baptist</l>
<l>Changed its first patron, wherefore he for this</l>

<l>Forever with his art will make it sad.</l>
<l>And were it not that on the pass of Arno</l>
<l>Some glimpses of him are remaining still,</l>

<l>Those citizens, who afterwards rebuilt it</l>
<l>Upon the ashes left by Attila,</l>
<l>In vain had caused their labour to be done.</l>

<l>Of my own house I made myself a gibbet."</l>

</canto>
<canto number="XIV">

<l>Because the charity of my native place</l>
<l>Constrained me, gathered I the scattered leaves,</l>
<l>And gave them back to him, who now was hoarse.</l>

<l>Then came we to the confine, where disparted</l>
<l>The second round is from the third, and where</l>
<l>A horrible form of Justice is beheld.</l>

<l>Clearly to manifest these novel things,</l>
<l>I say that we arrived upon a plain,</l>
<l>Which from its bed rejecteth every plant;</l>

<l>The dolorous forest is a garland to it</l>
<l>All round about, as the sad moat to that;</l>
<l>There close upon the edge we stayed our feet.</l>

<l>The soil was of an arid and thick sand,</l>
<l>Not of another fashion made than that</l>
<l>Which by the feet of Cato once was pressed.</l>

<l>Vengeance of God, O how much oughtest thou</l>
<l>By each one to be dreaded, who doth read</l>
<l>That which was manifest unto mine eyes!</l>

<l>Of naked souls beheld I many herds,</l>
<l>Who all were weeping very miserably,</l>
<l>And over them seemed set a law diverse.</l>

<l>Supine upon the ground some folk were lying;</l>
<l>And some were sitting all drawn up together,</l>
<l>And others went about continually.</l>

<l>Those who were going round were far the more,</l>
<l>And those were less who lay down to their torment,</l>
<l>But had their tongues more loosed to lamentation.</l>

<l>O'er all the sand-waste, with a gradual fall,</l>
<l>Were raining down dilated flakes of fire,</l>
<l>As of the snow on Alp without a wind.</l>

<l>As Alexander, in those torrid parts</l>
<l>Of India, beheld upon his host</l>
<l>Flames fall unbroken till they reached the ground.</l>

<l>Whence he provided with his phalanxes</l>
<l>To trample down the soil, because the vapour</l>
<l>Better extinguished was while it was single;</l>

<l>Thus was descending the eternal heat,</l>
<l>Whereby the sand was set on fire, like tinder</l>
<l>Beneath the steel, for doubling of the dole.</l>

<l>Without repose forever was the dance</l>
<l>Of miserable hands, now there, now here,</l>
<l>Shaking away from off them the fresh gleeds.</l>

<l>"Master," began I, "thou who overcomest</l>
<l>All things except the demons dire, that issued</l>
<l>Against us at the entrance of the gate,</l>

<l>Who is that mighty one who seems to heed not</l>
<l>The fire, and lieth lowering and disdainful,</l>
<l>So that the rain seems not to ripen him?"</l>

<l>And he himself, who had become aware</l>
<l>That I was questioning my Guide about him,</l>
<l>Cried: "Such as I was living, am I, dead.</l>

<l>If Jove should weary out his smith, from whom</l>
<l>He seized in anger the sharp thunderbolt,</l>
<l>Wherewith upon the last day I was smitten,</l>

<l>And if he wearied out by turns the others</l>
<l>In Mongibello at the swarthy forge,</l>
<l>Vociferating, 'Help, good Vulcan, help!'</l>

<l>Even as he did there at the fight of Phlegra,</l>
<l>And shot his bolts at me with all his might,</l>
<l>He would not have thereby a joyous vengeance."</l>

<l>Then did my Leader speak with such great force,</l>
<l>That I had never heard him speak so loud:</l>
<l>"O Capaneus, in that is not extinguished</l>

<l>Thine arrogance, thou punished art the more;</l>
<l>Not any torment, saving thine own rage,</l>
<l>Would be unto thy fury pain complete."</l>

<l>Then he turned round to me with better lip,</l>
<l>Saying: "One of the Seven Kings was he</l>
<l>Who Thebes besieged, and held, and seems to hold</l>

<l>God in disdain, and little seems to prize him;</l>
<l>But, as I said to him, his own despites</l>
<l>Are for his breast the fittest ornaments.</l>

<l>Now follow me, and mind thou do not place</l>
<l>As yet thy feet upon the burning sand,</l>
<l>But always keep them close unto the wood."</l>

<l>Speaking no word, we came to where there gushes</l>
<l>Forth from the wood a little rivulet,</l>
<l>Whose redness makes my hair still stand on end.</l>

<l>As from the Bulicame springs the brooklet,</l>
<l>The sinful women later share among them,</l>
<l>So downward through the sand it went its way.</l>

<l>The bottom of it, and both sloping banks,</l>
<l>Were made of stone, and the margins at the side;</l>
<l>Whence I perceived that there the passage was.</l>

<l>"In all the rest which I have shown to thee</l>
<l>Since we have entered in within the gate</l>
<l>Whose threshold unto no one is denied,</l>

<l>Nothing has been discovered by thine eyes</l>
<l>So notable as is the present river,</l>
<l>Which all the little flames above it quenches."</l>

<l>These words were of my Leader; whence I prayed him</l>
<l>That he would give me largess of the food,</l>
<l>For which he had given me largess of desire.</l>

<l>"In the mid-sea there sits a wasted land,"</l>
<l>Said he thereafterward, "whose name is Crete,</l>
<l>Under whose king the world of old was chaste.</l>

<l>There is a mountain there, that once was glad</l>
<l>With waters and with leaves, which was called Ida;</l>
<l>Now 'tis deserted, as a thing worn out.</l>

<l>Rhea once chose it for the faithful cradle</l>
<l>Of her own son; and to conceal him better,</l>
<l>Whene'er he cried, she there had clamours made.</l>

<l>A grand old man stands in the mount erect,</l>
<l>Who holds his shoulders turned tow'rds Damietta,</l>
<l>And looks at Rome as if it were his mirror.</l>

<l>His head is fashioned of refined gold,</l>
<l>And of pure silver are the arms and breast;</l>
<l>Then he is brass as far down as the fork.</l>

<l>From that point downward all is chosen iron,</l>
<l>Save that the right foot is of kiln-baked clay,</l>
<l>And more he stands on that than on the other.</l>

<l>Each part, except the gold, is by a fissure</l>
<l>Asunder cleft, that dripping is with tears,</l>
<l>Which gathered together perforate that cavern.</l>

<l>From rock to rock they fall into this valley;</l>
<l>Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon they form;</l>
<l>Then downward go along this narrow sluice</l>

<l>Unto that point where is no more descending.</l>
<l>They form Cocytus; what that pool may be</l>
<l>Thou shalt behold, so here 'tis not narrated."</l>

<l>And I to him: "If so the present runnel</l>
<l>Doth take its rise in this way from our world,</l>
<l>Why only on this verge appears it to us?"</l>

<l>And he to me: "Thou knowest the place is round,</l>
<l>And notwithstanding thou hast journeyed far,</l>
<l>Still to the left descending to the bottom,</l>

<l>Thou hast not yet through all the circle turned.</l>
<l>Therefore if something new appear to us,</l>
<l>It should not bring amazement to thy face."</l>

<l>And I again: "Master, where shall be found</l>
<l>Lethe and Phlegethon, for of one thou'rt silent,</l>
<l>And sayest the other of this rain is made?"</l>

<l>"In all thy questions truly thou dost please me,"</l>
<l>Replied he; "but the boiling of the red</l>
<l>Water might well solve one of them thou makest.</l>

<l>Thou shalt see Lethe, but outside this moat,</l>
<l>There where the souls repair to lave themselves,</l>
<l>When sin repented of has been removed."</l>

<l>Then said he: "It is time now to abandon</l>
<l>The wood; take heed that thou come after me;</l>
<l>A way the margins make that are not burning,</l>

<l>And over them all vapours are extinguished."</l>

</canto>
<canto number="XV">

<l>Now bears us onward one of the hard margins,</l>
<l>And so the brooklet's mist o'ershadows it,</l>
<l>From fire it saves the water and the dikes.</l>

<l>Even as the Flemings, 'twixt Cadsand and Bruges,</l>
<l>Fearing the flood that tow'rds them hurls itself,</l>
<l>Their bulwarks build to put the sea to flight;</l>

<l>And as the Paduans along the Brenta,</l>
<l>To guard their villas and their villages,</l>
<l>Or ever Chiarentana feel the heat;</l>

<l>In such similitude had those been made,</l>
<l>Albeit not so lofty nor so thick,</l>
<l>Whoever he might be, the master made them.</l>

<l>Now were we from the forest so remote,</l>
<l>I could not have discovered where it was,</l>
<l>Even if backward I had turned myself,</l>

<l>When we a company of souls encountered,</l>
<l>Who came beside the dike, and every one</l>
<l>Gazed at us, as at evening we are wont</l>

<l>To eye each other under a new moon,</l>
<l>And so towards us sharpened they their brows</l>
<l>As an old tailor at the needle's eye.</l>

<l>Thus scrutinised by such a family,</l>
<l>By some one I was recognised, who seized</l>
<l>My garment's hem, and cried out, "What a marvel!"</l>

<l>And I, when he stretched forth his arm to me,</l>
<l>On his baked aspect fastened so mine eyes,</l>
<l>That the scorched countenance prevented not</l>

<l>His recognition by my intellect;</l>
<l>And bowing down my face unto his own,</l>
<l>I made reply, "Are you here, Ser Brunetto?"</l>

<l>And he: "May't not displease thee, O my son,</l>
<l>If a brief space with thee Brunetto Latini</l>
<l>Backward return and let the trail go on."</l>

<l>I said to him: "With all my power I ask it;</l>
<l>And if you wish me to sit down with you,</l>
<l>I will, if he please, for I go with him."</l>

<l>"O son," he said, "whoever of this herd</l>
<l>A moment stops, lies then a hundred years,</l>
<l>Nor fans himself when smiteth him the fire.</l>

<l>Therefore go on; I at thy skirts will come,</l>
<l>And afterward will I rejoin my band,</l>
<l>Which goes lamenting its eternal doom."</l>

<l>I did not dare to go down from the road</l>
<l>Level to walk with him; but my head bowed</l>
<l>I held as one who goeth reverently.</l>

<l>And he began: "What fortune or what fate</l>
<l>Before the last day leadeth thee down here?</l>
<l>And who is this that showeth thee the way?"</l>

<l>"Up there above us in the life serene,"</l>
<l>I answered him, "I lost me in a valley,</l>
<l>Or ever yet my age had been completed.</l>

<l>But yestermorn I turned my back upon it;</l>
<l>This one appeared to me, returning thither,</l>
<l>And homeward leadeth me along this road."</l>

<l>And he to me: "If thou thy star do follow,</l>
<l>Thou canst not fail thee of a glorious port,</l>
<l>If well I judged in the life beautiful.</l>

<l>And if I had not died so prematurely,</l>
<l>Seeing Heaven thus benignant unto thee,</l>
<l>I would have given thee comfort in the work.</l>

<l>But that ungrateful and malignant people,</l>
<l>Which of old time from Fesole descended,</l>
<l>And smacks still of the mountain and the granite,</l>

<l>Will make itself, for thy good deeds, thy foe;</l>
<l>And it is right; for among crabbed sorbs</l>
<l>It ill befits the sweet fig to bear fruit.</l>

<l>Old rumour in the world proclaims them blind;</l>
<l>A people avaricious, envious, proud;</l>
<l>Take heed that of their customs thou do cleanse thee.</l>

<l>Thy fortune so much honour doth reserve thee,</l>
<l>One party and the other shall be hungry</l>
<l>For thee; but far from goat shall be the grass.</l>

<l>Their litter let the beasts of Fesole</l>
<l>Make of themselves, nor let them touch the plant,</l>
<l>If any still upon their dunghill rise,</l>

<l>In which may yet revive the consecrated</l>
<l>Seed of those Romans, who remained there when</l>
<l>The nest of such great malice it became."</l>

<l>"If my entreaty wholly were fulfilled,"</l>
<l>Replied I to him, "not yet would you be</l>
<l>In banishment from human nature placed;</l>

<l>For in my mind is fixed, and touches now</l>
<l>My heart the dear and good paternal image</l>
<l>Of you, when in the world from hour to hour</l>

<l>You taught me how a man becomes eternal;</l>
<l>And how much I am grateful, while I live</l>
<l>Behoves that in my language be discerned.</l>

<l>What you narrate of my career I write,</l>
<l>And keep it to be glossed with other text</l>
<l>By a Lady who can do it, if I reach her.</l>

<l>This much will I have manifest to you;</l>
<l>Provided that my conscience do not chide me,</l>
<l>For whatsoever Fortune I am ready.</l>

<l>Such handsel is not new unto mine ears;</l>
<l>Therefore let Fortune turn her wheel around</l>
<l>As it may please her, and the churl his mattock."</l>

<l>My Master thereupon on his right cheek</l>
<l>Did backward turn himself, and looked at me;</l>
<l>Then said: "He listeneth well who noteth it."</l>

<l>Nor speaking less on that account, I go</l>
<l>With Ser Brunetto, and I ask who are</l>
<l>His most known and most eminent companions.</l>

<l>And he to me: "To know of some is well;</l>
<l>Of others it were laudable to be silent,</l>
<l>For short would be the time for so much speech.</l>

<l>Know them in sum, that all of them were clerks,</l>
<l>And men of letters great and of great fame,</l>
<l>In the world tainted with the selfsame sin.</l>

<l>Priscian goes yonder with that wretched crowd,</l>
<l>And Francis of Accorso; and thou hadst seen there</l>
<l>If thou hadst had a hankering for such scurf,</l>

<l>That one, who by the Servant of the Servants</l>
<l>From Arno was transferred to Bacchiglione,</l>
<l>Where he has left his sin-excited nerves.</l>

<l>More would I say, but coming and discoursing</l>
<l>Can be no longer; for that I behold</l>
<l>New smoke uprising yonder from the sand.</l>

<l>A people comes with whom I may not be;</l>
<l>Commended unto thee be my Tesoro,</l>
<l>In which I still live, and no more I ask."</l>

<l>Then he turned round, and seemed to be of those</l>
<l>Who at Verona run for the Green Mantle</l>
<l>Across the plain; and seemed to be among them</l>

<l>The one who wins, and not the one who loses.</l>

</canto>
<canto number="XVI">

<l>Now was I where was heard the reverberation</l>
<l>Of water falling into the next round,</l>
<l>Like to that humming which the beehives make,</l>

<l>When shadows three together started forth,</l>
<l>Running, from out a company that passed</l>
<l>Beneath the rain of the sharp martyrdom.</l>

<l>Towards us came they, and each one cried out:</l>
<l>"Stop, thou; for by thy garb to us thou seemest</l>
<l>To be some one of our depraved city."</l>

<l>Ah me! what wounds I saw upon their limbs,</l>
<l>Recent and ancient by the flames burnt in!</l>
<l>It pains me still but to remember it.</l>

<l>Unto their cries my Teacher paused attentive;</l>
<l>He turned his face towards me, and "Now wait,"</l>
<l>He said; "to these we should be courteous.</l>

<l>And if it were not for the fire that darts</l>
<l>The nature of this region, I should say</l>
<l>That haste were more becoming thee than them."</l>

<l>As soon as we stood still, they recommenced</l>
<l>The old refrain, and when they overtook us,</l>
<l>Formed of themselves a wheel, all three of them.</l>

<l>As champions stripped and oiled are wont to do,</l>
<l>Watching for their advantage and their hold,</l>
<l>Before they come to blows and thrusts between them,</l>

<l>Thus, wheeling round, did every one his visage</l>
<l>Direct to me, so that in opposite wise</l>
<l>His neck and feet continual journey made.</l>

<l>And, "If the misery of this soft place</l>
<l>Bring in disdain ourselves and our entreaties,"</l>
<l>Began one, "and our aspect black and blistered,</l>

<l>Let the renown of us thy mind incline</l>
<l>To tell us who thou art, who thus securely</l>
<l>Thy living feet dost move along through Hell.</l>

<l>He in whose footprints thou dost see me treading,</l>
<l>Naked and skinless though he now may go,</l>
<l>Was of a greater rank than thou dost think;</l>

<l>He was the grandson of the good Gualdrada;</l>
<l>His name was Guidoguerra, and in life</l>
<l>Much did he with his wisdom and his sword.</l>

<l>The other, who close by me treads the sand,</l>
<l>Tegghiaio Aldobrandi is, whose fame</l>
<l>Above there in the world should welcome be.</l>

<l>And I, who with them on the cross am placed,</l>
<l>Jacopo Rusticucci was; and truly</l>
<l>My savage wife, more than aught else, doth harm me."</l>

<l>Could I have been protected from the fire,</l>
<l>Below I should have thrown myself among them,</l>
<l>And think the Teacher would have suffered it;</l>

<l>But as I should have burned and baked myself,</l>
<l>My terror overmastered my good will,</l>
<l>Which made me greedy of embracing them.</l>

<l>Then I began: "Sorrow and not disdain</l>
<l>Did your condition fix within me so,</l>
<l>That tardily it wholly is stripped off,</l>

<l>As soon as this my Lord said unto me</l>
<l>Words, on account of which I thought within me</l>
<l>That people such as you are were approaching.</l>

<l>I of your city am; and evermore</l>
<l>Your labours and your honourable names</l>
<l>I with affection have retraced and heard.</l>

<l>I leave the gall, and go for the sweet fruits</l>
<l>Promised to me by the veracious Leader;</l>
<l>But to the centre first I needs must plunge."</l>

<l>"So may the soul for a long while conduct</l>
<l>Those limbs of thine," did he make answer then,</l>
<l>"And so may thy renown shine after thee,</l>

<l>Valour and courtesy, say if they dwell</l>
<l>Within our city, as they used to do,</l>
<l>Or if they wholly have gone out of it;</l>

<l>For Guglielmo Borsier, who is in torment</l>
<l>With us of late, and goes there with his comrades,</l>
<l>Doth greatly mortify us with his words."</l>

<l>"The new inhabitants and the sudden gains,</l>
<l>Pride and extravagance have in thee engendered,</l>
<l>Florence, so that thou weep'st thereat already!"</l>

<l>In this wise I exclaimed with face uplifted;</l>
<l>And the three, taking that for my reply,</l>
<l>Looked at each other, as one looks at truth.</l>

<l>"If other times so little it doth cost thee,"</l>
<l>Replied they all, "to satisfy another,</l>
<l>Happy art thou, thus speaking at thy will!</l>

<l>Therefore, if thou escape from these dark places,</l>
<l>And come to rebehold the beauteous stars,</l>
<l>When it shall pleasure thee to say, 'I was,'</l>

<l>See that thou speak of us unto the people."</l>
<l>Then they broke up the wheel, and in their flight</l>
<l>It seemed as if their agile legs were wings.</l>

<l>Not an Amen could possibly be said</l>
<l>So rapidly as they had disappeared;</l>
<l>Wherefore the Master deemed best to depart.</l>

<l>I followed him, and little had we gone,</l>
<l>Before the sound of water was so near us,</l>
<l>That speaking we should hardly have been heard.</l>

<l>Even as that stream which holdeth its own course</l>
<l>The first from Monte Veso tow'rds the East,</l>
<l>Upon the left-hand slope of Apennine,</l>

<l>Which is above called Acquacheta, ere</l>
<l>It down descendeth into its low bed,</l>
<l>And at Forli is vacant of that name,</l>

<l>Reverberates there above San Benedetto</l>
<l>From Alps, by falling at a single leap,</l>
<l>Where for a thousand there were room enough;</l>

<l>Thus downward from a bank precipitate,</l>
<l>We found resounding that dark-tinted water,</l>
<l>So that it soon the ear would have offended.</l>

<l>I had a cord around about me girt,</l>
<l>And therewithal I whilom had designed</l>
<l>To take the panther with the painted skin.</l>

<l>After I this had all from me unloosed,</l>
<l>As my Conductor had commanded me,</l>
<l>I reached it to him, gathered up and coiled,</l>

<l>Whereat he turned himself to the right side,</l>
<l>And at a little distance from the verge,</l>
<l>He cast it down into that deep abyss.</l>

<l>"It must needs be some novelty respond,"</l>
<l>I said within myself, "to the new signal</l>
<l>The Master with his eye is following so."</l>

<l>Ah me! how very cautious men should be</l>
<l>With those who not alone behold the act,</l>
<l>But with their wisdom look into the thoughts!</l>

<l>He said to me: "Soon there will upward come</l>
<l>What I await; and what thy thought is dreaming</l>
<l>Must soon reveal itself unto thy sight."</l>

<l>Aye to that truth which has the face of falsehood,</l>
<l>A man should close his lips as far as may be,</l>
<l>Because without his fault it causes shame;</l>

<l>But here I cannot; and, Reader, by the notes</l>
<l>Of this my Comedy to thee I swear,</l>
<l>So may they not be void of lasting favour,</l>

<l>Athwart that dense and darksome atmosphere</l>
<l>I saw a figure swimming upward come,</l>
<l>Marvellous unto every steadfast heart,</l>

<l>Even as he returns who goeth down</l>
<l>Sometimes to clear an anchor, which has grappled</l>
<l>Reef, or aught else that in the sea is hidden,</l>

<l>Who upward stretches, and draws in his feet.</l>

</canto>
<canto number="XVII">

<l>"Behold the monster with the pointed tail,</l>
<l>Who cleaves the hills, and breaketh walls and weapons,</l>
<l>Behold him who infecteth all the world."</l>

<l>Thus unto me my Guide began to say,</l>
<l>And beckoned him that he should come to shore,</l>
<l>Near to the confine of the trodden marble;</l>

<l>And that uncleanly image of deceit</l>
<l>Came up and thrust ashore its head and bust,</l>
<l>But on the border did not drag its tail.</l>

<l>The face was as the face of a just man,</l>
<l>Its semblance outwardly was so benign,</l>
<l>And of a serpent all the trunk beside.</l>

<l>Two paws it had, hairy unto the armpits;</l>
<l>The back, and breast, and both the sides it had</l>
<l>Depicted o'er with nooses and with shields.</l>

<l>With colours more, groundwork or broidery</l>
<l>Never in cloth did Tartars make nor Turks,</l>
<l>Nor were such tissues by Arachne laid.</l>

<l>As sometimes wherries lie upon the shore,</l>
<l>That part are in the water, part on land;</l>
<l>And as among the guzzling Germans there,</l>

<l>The beaver plants himself to wage his war;</l>
<l>So that vile monster lay upon the border,</l>
<l>Which is of stone, and shutteth in the sand.</l>

<l>His tail was wholly quivering in the void,</l>
<l>Contorting upwards the envenomed fork,</l>
<l>That in the guise of scorpion armed its point.</l>

<l>The Guide said: "Now perforce must turn aside</l>
<l>Our way a little, even to that beast</l>
<l>Malevolent, that yonder coucheth him."</l>

<l>We therefore on the right side descended,</l>
<l>And made ten steps upon the outer verge,</l>
<l>Completely to avoid the sand and flame;</l>

<l>And after we are come to him, I see</l>
<l>A little farther off upon the sand</l>
<l>A people sitting near the hollow place.</l>

<l>Then said to me the Master: "So that full</l>
<l>Experience of this round thou bear away,</l>
<l>Now go and see what their condition is.</l>

<l>There let thy conversation be concise;</l>
<l>Till thou returnest I will speak with him,</l>
<l>That he concede to us his stalwart shoulders."</l>

<l>Thus farther still upon the outermost</l>
<l>Head of that seventh circle all alone</l>
<l>I went, where sat the melancholy folk.</l>

<l>Out of their eyes was gushing forth their woe;</l>
<l>This way, that way, they helped them with their hands</l>
<l>Now from the flames and now from the hot soil.</l>

<l>Not otherwise in summer do the dogs,</l>
<l>Now with the foot, now with the muzzle, when</l>
<l>By fleas, or flies, or gadflies, they are bitten.</l>

<l>When I had turned mine eyes upon the faces</l>
<l>Of some, on whom the dolorous fire is falling,</l>
<l>Not one of them I knew; but I perceived</l>

<l>That from the neck of each there hung a pouch,</l>
<l>Which certain colour had, and certain blazon;</l>
<l>And thereupon it seems their eyes are feeding.</l>

<l>And as I gazing round me come among them,</l>
<l>Upon a yellow pouch I azure saw</l>
<l>That had the face and posture of a lion.</l>

<l>Proceeding then the current of my sight,</l>
<l>Another of them saw I, red as blood,</l>
<l>Display a goose more white than butter is.</l>

<l>And one, who with an azure sow and gravid</l>
<l>Emblazoned had his little pouch of white,</l>
<l>Said unto me: "What dost thou in this moat?</l>

<l>Now get thee gone; and since thou'rt still alive,</l>
<l>Know that a neighbour of mine, Vitaliano,</l>
<l>Will have his seat here on my left-hand side.</l>

<l>A Paduan am I with these Florentines;</l>
<l>Full many a time they thunder in mine ears,</l>
<l>Exclaiming, 'Come the sovereign cavalier,</l>

<l>He who shall bring the satchel with three goats;'"</l>
<l>Then twisted he his mouth, and forth he thrust</l>
<l>His tongue, like to an ox that licks its nose.</l>

<l>And fearing lest my longer stay might vex</l>
<l>Him who had warned me not to tarry long,</l>
<l>Backward I turned me from those weary souls.</l>

<l>I found my Guide, who had already mounted</l>
<l>Upon the back of that wild animal,</l>
<l>And said to me: "Now be both strong and bold.</l>

<l>Now we descend by stairways such as these;</l>
<l>Mount thou in front, for I will be midway,</l>
<l>So that the tail may have no power to harm thee."</l>

<l>Such as he is who has so near the ague</l>
<l>Of quartan that his nails are blue already,</l>
<l>And trembles all, but looking at the shade;</l>

<l>Even such became I at those proffered words;</l>
<l>But shame in me his menaces produced,</l>
<l>Which maketh servant strong before good master.</l>

<l>I seated me upon those monstrous shoulders;</l>
<l>I wished to say, and yet the voice came not</l>
<l>As I believed, "Take heed that thou embrace me."</l>

<l>But he, who other times had rescued me</l>
<l>In other peril, soon as I had mounted,</l>
<l>Within his arms encircled and sustained me,</l>

<l>And said: "Now, Geryon, bestir thyself;</l>
<l>The circles large, and the descent be little;</l>
<l>Think of the novel burden which thou hast."</l>

<l>Even as the little vessel shoves from shore,</l>
<l>Backward, still backward, so he thence withdrew;</l>
<l>And when he wholly felt himself afloat,</l>

<l>There where his breast had been he turned his tail,</l>
<l>And that extended like an eel he moved,</l>
<l>And with his paws drew to himself the air.</l>

<l>A greater fear I do not think there was</l>
<l>What time abandoned Phaeton the reins,</l>
<l>Whereby the heavens, as still appears, were scorched;</l>

<l>Nor when the wretched Icarus his flanks</l>
<l>Felt stripped of feathers by the melting wax,</l>
<l>His father crying, "An ill way thou takest!"</l>

<l>Than was my own, when I perceived myself</l>
<l>On all sides in the air, and saw extinguished</l>
<l>The sight of everything but of the monster.</l>

<l>Onward he goeth, swimming slowly, slowly;</l>
<l>Wheels and descends, but I perceive it only</l>
<l>By wind upon my face and from below.</l>

<l>I heard already on the right the whirlpool</l>
<l>Making a horrible crashing under us;</l>
<l>Whence I thrust out my head with eyes cast downward.</l>

<l>Then was I still more fearful of the abyss;</l>
<l>Because I fires beheld, and heard laments,</l>
<l>Whereat I, trembling, all the closer cling.</l>

<l>I saw then, for before I had not seen it,</l>
<l>The turning and descending, by great horrors</l>
<l>That were approaching upon divers sides.</l>

<l>As falcon who has long been on the wing,</l>
<l>Who, without seeing either lure or bird,</l>
<l>Maketh the falconer say, "Ah me, thou stoopest,"</l>

<l>Descendeth weary, whence he started swiftly,</l>
<l>Thorough a hundred circles, and alights</l>
<l>Far from his master, sullen and disdainful;</l>

<l>Even thus did Geryon place us on the bottom,</l>
<l>Close to the bases of the rough-hewn rock,</l>
<l>And being disencumbered of our persons,</l>

<l>He sped away as arrow from the string.</l>

</canto>
<canto number="XVIII">

<l>There is a place in Hell called Malebolge,</l>
<l>Wholly of stone and of an iron colour,</l>
<l>As is the circle that around it turns.</l>

<l>Right in the middle of the field malign</l>
<l>There yawns a well exceeding wide and deep,</l>
<l>Of which its place the structure will recount.</l>

<l>Round, then, is that enclosure which remains</l>
<l>Between the well and foot of the high, hard bank,</l>
<l>And has distinct in valleys ten its bottom.</l>

<l>As where for the protection of the walls</l>
<l>Many and many moats surround the castles,</l>
<l>The part in which they are a figure forms,</l>

<l>Just such an image those presented there;</l>
<l>And as about such strongholds from their gates</l>
<l>Unto the outer bank are little bridges,</l>

<l>So from the precipice's base did crags</l>
<l>Project, which intersected dikes and moats,</l>
<l>Unto the well that truncates and collects them.</l>

<l>Within this place, down shaken from the back</l>
<l>Of Geryon, we found us; and the Poet</l>
<l>Held to the left, and I moved on behind.</l>

<l>Upon my right hand I beheld new anguish,</l>
<l>New torments, and new wielders of the lash,</l>
<l>Wherewith the foremost Bolgia was replete.</l>

<l>Down at the bottom were the sinners naked;</l>
<l>This side the middle came they facing us,</l>
<l>Beyond it, with us, but with greater steps;</l>

<l>Even as the Romans, for the mighty host,</l>
<l>The year of Jubilee, upon the bridge,</l>
<l>Have chosen a mode to pass the people over;</l>

<l>For all upon one side towards the Castle</l>
<l>Their faces have, and go unto St. Peter's;</l>
<l>On the other side they go towards the Mountain.</l>

<l>This side and that, along the livid stone</l>
<l>Beheld I horned demons with great scourges,</l>
<l>Who cruelly were beating them behind.</l>

<l>Ah me! how they did make them lift their legs</l>
<l>At the first blows! and sooth not any one</l>
<l>The second waited for, nor for the third.</l>

<l>While I was going on, mine eyes by one</l>
<l>Encountered were; and straight I said: "Already</l>
<l>With sight of this one I am not unfed."</l>

<l>Therefore I stayed my feet to make him out,</l>
<l>And with me the sweet Guide came to a stand,</l>
<l>And to my going somewhat back assented;</l>

<l>And he, the scourged one, thought to hide himself,</l>
<l>Lowering his face, but little it availed him;</l>
<l>For said I: "Thou that castest down thine eyes,</l>

<l>If false are not the features which thou bearest,</l>
<l>Thou art Venedico Caccianimico;</l>
<l>But what doth bring thee to such pungent sauces?"</l>

<l>And he to me: "Unwillingly I tell it;</l>
<l>But forces me thine utterance distinct,</l>
<l>Which makes me recollect the ancient world.</l>

<l>I was the one who the fair Ghisola</l>
<l>Induced to grant the wishes of the Marquis,</l>
<l>Howe'er the shameless story may be told.</l>

<l>Not the sole Bolognese am I who weeps here;</l>
<l>Nay, rather is this place so full of them,</l>
<l>That not so many tongues to-day are taught</l>

<l>'Twixt Reno and Savena to say 'sipa;'</l>
<l>And if thereof thou wishest pledge or proof,</l>
<l>Bring to thy mind our avaricious heart."</l>

<l>While speaking in this manner, with his scourge</l>
<l>A demon smote him, and said: "Get thee gone</l>
<l>Pander, there are no women here for coin."</l>

<l>I joined myself again unto mine Escort;</l>
<l>Thereafterward with footsteps few we came</l>
<l>To where a crag projected from the bank.</l>

<l>This very easily did we ascend,</l>
<l>And turning to the right along its ridge,</l>
<l>From those eternal circles we departed.</l>

<l>When we were there, where it is hollowed out</l>
<l>Beneath, to give a passage to the scourged,</l>
<l>The Guide said: "Wait, and see that on thee strike</l>

<l>The vision of those others evil-born,</l>
<l>Of whom thou hast not yet beheld the faces,</l>
<l>Because together with us they have gone."</l>

<l>From the old bridge we looked upon the train</l>
<l>Which tow'rds us came upon the other border,</l>
<l>And which the scourges in like manner smite.</l>

<l>And the good Master, without my inquiring,</l>
<l>Said to me: "See that tall one who is coming,</l>
<l>And for his pain seems not to shed a tear;</l>

<l>Still what a royal aspect he retains!</l>
<l>That Jason is, who by his heart and cunning</l>
<l>The Colchians of the Ram made destitute.</l>

<l>He by the isle of Lemnos passed along</l>
<l>After the daring women pitiless</l>
<l>Had unto death devoted all their males.</l>

<l>There with his tokens and with ornate words</l>
<l>Did he deceive Hypsipyle, the maiden</l>
<l>Who first, herself, had all the rest deceived.</l>

<l>There did he leave her pregnant and forlorn;</l>
<l>Such sin unto such punishment condemns him,</l>
<l>And also for Medea is vengeance done.</l>

<l>With him go those who in such wise deceive;</l>
<l>And this sufficient be of the first valley</l>
<l>To know, and those that in its jaws it holds."</l>

<l>We were already where the narrow path</l>
<l>Crosses athwart the second dike, and forms</l>
<l>Of that a buttress for another arch.</l>

<l>Thence we heard people, who are making moan</l>
<l>In the next Bolgia, snorting with their muzzles,</l>
<l>And with their palms beating upon themselves</l>

<l>The margins were incrusted with a mould</l>
<l>By exhalation from below, that sticks there,</l>
<l>And with the eyes and nostrils wages war.</l>

<l>The bottom is so deep, no place suffices</l>
<l>To give us sight of it, without ascending</l>
<l>The arch's back, where most the crag impends.</l>

<l>Thither we came, and thence down in the moat</l>
<l>I saw a people smothered in a filth</l>
<l>That out of human privies seemed to flow;</l>

<l>And whilst below there with mine eye I search,</l>
<l>I saw one with his head so foul with ordure,</l>
<l>It was not clear if he were clerk or layman.</l>

<l>He screamed to me: "Wherefore art thou so eager</l>
<l>To look at me more than the other foul ones?"</l>
<l>And I to him: "Because, if I remember,</l>

<l>I have already seen thee with dry hair,</l>
<l>And thou'rt Alessio Interminei of Lucca;</l>
<l>Therefore I eye thee more than all the others."</l>

<l>And he thereon, belabouring his pumpkin:</l>
<l>"The flatteries have submerged me here below,</l>
<l>Wherewith my tongue was never surfeited."</l>

<l>Then said to me the Guide: "See that thou thrust</l>
<l>Thy visage somewhat farther in advance,</l>
<l>That with thine eyes thou well the face attain</l>

<l>Of that uncleanly and dishevelled drab,</l>
<l>Who there doth scratch herself with filthy nails,</l>
<l>And crouches now, and now on foot is standing.</l>

<l>Thais the harlot is it, who replied</l>
<l>Unto her paramour, when he said, 'Have I</l>
<l>Great gratitude from thee?'--'Nay, marvellous;'</l>

<l>And herewith let our sight be satisfied."</l>

</canto>
<canto number="XIX">

<l>O Simon Magus, O forlorn disciples,</l>
<l>Ye who the things of God, which ought to be</l>
<l>The brides of holiness, rapaciously</l>

<l>For silver and for gold do prostitute,</l>
<l>Now it behoves for you the trumpet sound,</l>
<l>Because in this third Bolgia ye abide.</l>

<l>We had already on the following tomb</l>
<l>Ascended to that portion of the crag</l>
<l>Which o'er the middle of the moat hangs plumb.</l>

<l>Wisdom supreme, O how great art thou showest</l>
<l>In heaven, in earth, and in the evil world,</l>
<l>And with what justice doth thy power distribute!</l>

<l>I saw upon the sides and on the bottom</l>
<l>The livid stone with perforations filled,</l>
<l>All of one size, and every one was round.</l>

<l>To me less ample seemed they not, nor greater</l>
<l>Than those that in my beautiful Saint John</l>
<l>Are fashioned for the place of the baptisers,</l>

<l>And one of which, not many years ago,</l>
<l>I broke for some one, who was drowning in it;</l>
<l>Be this a seal all men to undeceive.</l>

<l>Out of the mouth of each one there protruded</l>
<l>The feet of a transgressor, and the legs</l>
<l>Up to the calf, the rest within remained.</l>

<l>In all of them the soles were both on fire;</l>
<l>Wherefore the joints so violently quivered,</l>
<l>They would have snapped asunder withes and bands.</l>

<l>Even as the flame of unctuous things is wont</l>
<l>To move upon the outer surface only,</l>
<l>So likewise was it there from heel to point.</l>

<l>"Master, who is that one who writhes himself,</l>
<l>More than his other comrades quivering,"</l>
<l>I said, "and whom a redder flame is sucking?"</l>

<l>And he to me: "If thou wilt have me bear thee</l>
<l>Down there along that bank which lowest lies,</l>
<l>From him thou'lt know his errors and himself."</l>

<l>And I: "What pleases thee, to me is pleasing;</l>
<l>Thou art my Lord, and knowest that I depart not</l>
<l>From thy desire, and knowest what is not spoken."</l>

<l>Straightway upon the fourth dike we arrived;</l>
<l>We turned, and on the left-hand side descended</l>
<l>Down to the bottom full of holes and narrow.</l>

<l>And the good Master yet from off his haunch</l>
<l>Deposed me not, till to the hole he brought me</l>
<l>Of him who so lamented with his shanks.</l>

<l>"Whoe'er thou art, that standest upside down,</l>
<l>O doleful soul, implanted like a stake,"</l>
<l>To say began I, "if thou canst, speak out."</l>

<l>I stood even as the friar who is confessing</l>
<l>The false assassin, who, when he is fixed,</l>
<l>Recalls him, so that death may be delayed.</l>

<l>And he cried out: "Dost thou stand there already,</l>
<l>Dost thou stand there already, Boniface?</l>
<l>By many years the record lied to me.</l>

<l>Art thou so early satiate with that wealth,</l>
<l>For which thou didst not fear to take by fraud</l>
<l>The beautiful Lady, and then work her woe?"</l>

<l>Such I became, as people are who stand,</l>
<l>Not comprehending what is answered them,</l>
<l>As if bemocked, and know not how to answer.</l>

<l>Then said Virgilius: "Say to him straightway,</l>
<l>'I am not he, I am not he thou thinkest.'"</l>
<l>And I replied as was imposed on me.</l>

<l>Whereat the spirit writhed with both his feet,</l>
<l>Then, sighing, with a voice of lamentation</l>
<l>Said to me: "Then what wantest thou of me?</l>

<l>If who I am thou carest so much to know,</l>
<l>That thou on that account hast crossed the bank,</l>
<l>Know that I vested was with the great mantle;</l>

<l>And truly was I son of the She-bear,</l>
<l>So eager to advance the cubs, that wealth</l>
<l>Above, and here myself, I pocketed.</l>

<l>Beneath my head the others are dragged down</l>
<l>Who have preceded me in simony,</l>
<l>Flattened along the fissure of the rock.</l>

<l>Below there I shall likewise fall, whenever</l>
<l>That one shall come who I believed thou wast,</l>
<l>What time the sudden question I proposed.</l>

<l>But longer I my feet already toast,</l>
<l>And here have been in this way upside down,</l>
<l>Than he will planted stay with reddened feet;</l>

<l>For after him shall come of fouler deed</l>
<l>From tow'rds the west a Pastor without law,</l>
<l>Such as befits to cover him and me.</l>

<l>New Jason will he be, of whom we read</l>
<l>In Maccabees; and as his king was pliant,</l>
<l>So he who governs France shall be to this one."</l>

<l>I do not know if I were here too bold,</l>
<l>That him I answered only in this metre:</l>
<l>"I pray thee tell me now how great a treasure</l>

<l>Our Lord demanded of Saint Peter first,</l>
<l>Before he put the keys into his keeping?</l>
<l>Truly he nothing asked but 'Follow me.'</l>

<l>Nor Peter nor the rest asked of Matthias</l>
<l>Silver or gold, when he by lot was chosen</l>
<l>Unto the place the guilty soul had lost.</l>

<l>Therefore stay here, for thou art justly punished,</l>
<l>And keep safe guard o'er the ill-gotten money,</l>
<l>Which caused thee to be valiant against Charles.</l>

<l>And were it not that still forbids it me</l>
<l>The reverence for the keys superlative</l>
<l>Thou hadst in keeping in the gladsome life,</l>

<l>I would make use of words more grievous still;</l>
<l>Because your avarice afflicts the world,</l>
<l>Trampling the good and lifting the depraved.</l>

<l>The Evangelist you Pastors had in mind,</l>
<l>When she who sitteth upon many waters</l>
<l>To fornicate with kings by him was seen;</l>

<l>The same who with the seven heads was born,</l>
<l>And power and strength from the ten horns received,</l>
<l>So long as virtue to her spouse was pleasing.</l>

<l>Ye have made yourselves a god of gold and silver;</l>
<l>And from the idolater how differ ye,</l>
<l>Save that he one, and ye a hundred worship?</l>

<l>Ah, Constantine! of how much ill was mother,</l>
<l>Not thy conversion, but that marriage dower</l>
<l>Which the first wealthy Father took from thee!"</l>

<l>And while I sang to him such notes as these,</l>
<l>Either that anger or that conscience stung him,</l>
<l>He struggled violently with both his feet.</l>

<l>I think in sooth that it my Leader pleased,</l>
<l>With such contented lip he listened ever</l>
<l>Unto the sound of the true words expressed.</l>

<l>Therefore with both his arms he took me up,</l>
<l>And when he had me all upon his breast,</l>
<l>Remounted by the way where he descended.</l>

<l>Nor did he tire to have me clasped to him;</l>
<l>But bore me to the summit of the arch</l>
<l>Which from the fourth dike to the fifth is passage.</l>

<l>There tenderly he laid his burden down,</l>
<l>Tenderly on the crag uneven and steep,</l>
<l>That would have been hard passage for the goats:</l>

<l>Thence was unveiled to me another valley.</l>

</canto>
<canto number="XX">

<l>Of a new pain behoves me to make verses</l>
<l>And give material to the twentieth canto</l>
<l>Of the first song, which is of the submerged.</l>

<l>I was already thoroughly disposed</l>
<l>To peer down into the uncovered depth,</l>
<l>Which bathed itself with tears of agony;</l>

<l>And people saw I through the circular valley,</l>
<l>Silent and weeping, coming at the pace</l>
<l>Which in this world the Litanies assume.</l>

<l>As lower down my sight descended on them,</l>
<l>Wondrously each one seemed to be distorted</l>
<l>From chin to the beginning of the chest;</l>

<l>For tow'rds the reins the countenance was turned,</l>
<l>And backward it behoved them to advance,</l>
<l>As to look forward had been taken from them.</l>

<l>Perchance indeed by violence of palsy</l>
<l>Some one has been thus wholly turned awry;</l>
<l>But I ne'er saw it, nor believe it can be.</l>

<l>As God may let thee, Reader, gather fruit</l>
<l>From this thy reading, think now for thyself</l>
<l>How I could ever keep my face unmoistened,</l>

<l>When our own image near me I beheld</l>
<l>Distorted so, the weeping of the eyes</l>
<l>Along the fissure bathed the hinder parts.</l>

<l>Truly I wept, leaning upon a peak</l>
<l>Of the hard crag, so that my Escort said</l>
<l>To me: "Art thou, too, of the other fools?</l>

<l>Here pity lives when it is wholly dead;</l>
<l>Who is a greater reprobate than he</l>
<l>Who feels compassion at the doom divine?</l>

<l>Lift up, lift up thy head, and see for whom</l>
<l>Opened the earth before the Thebans' eyes;</l>
<l>Wherefore they all cried: 'Whither rushest thou,</l>

<l>Amphiaraus?  Why dost leave the war?'</l>
<l>And downward ceased he not to fall amain</l>
<l>As far as Minos, who lays hold on all.</l>

<l>See, he has made a bosom of his shoulders!</l>
<l>Because he wished to see too far before him</l>
<l>Behind he looks, and backward goes his way:</l>

<l>Behold Tiresias, who his semblance changed,</l>
<l>When from a male a female he became,</l>
<l>His members being all of them transformed;</l>

<l>And afterwards was forced to strike once more</l>
<l>The two entangled serpents with his rod,</l>
<l>Ere he could have again his manly plumes.</l>

<l>That Aruns is, who backs the other's belly,</l>
<l>Who in the hills of Luni, there where grubs</l>
<l>The Carrarese who houses underneath,</l>

<l>Among the marbles white a cavern had</l>
<l>For his abode; whence to behold the stars</l>
<l>And sea, the view was not cut off from him.</l>

<l>And she there, who is covering up her breasts,</l>
<l>Which thou beholdest not, with loosened tresses,</l>
<l>And on that side has all the hairy skin,</l>

<l>Was Manto, who made quest through many lands,</l>
<l>Afterwards tarried there where I was born;</l>
<l>Whereof I would thou list to me a little.</l>

<l>After her father had from life departed,</l>
<l>And the city of Bacchus had become enslaved,</l>
<l>She a long season wandered through the world.</l>

<l>Above in beauteous Italy lies a lake</l>
<l>At the Alp's foot that shuts in Germany</l>
<l>Over Tyrol, and has the name Benaco.</l>

<l>By a thousand springs, I think, and more, is bathed,</l>
<l>'Twixt Garda and Val Camonica, Pennino,</l>
<l>With water that grows stagnant in that lake.</l>

<l>Midway a place is where the Trentine Pastor,</l>
<l>And he of Brescia, and the Veronese</l>
<l>Might give his blessing, if he passed that way.</l>

<l>Sitteth Peschiera, fortress fair and strong,</l>
<l>To front the Brescians and the Bergamasks,</l>
<l>Where round about the bank descendeth lowest.</l>

<l>There of necessity must fall whatever</l>
<l>In bosom of Benaco cannot stay,</l>
<l>And grows a river down through verdant pastures.</l>

<l>Soon as the water doth begin to run,</l>
<l>No more Benaco is it called, but Mincio,</l>
<l>Far as Governo, where it falls in Po.</l>

<l>Not far it runs before it finds a plain</l>
<l>In which it spreads itself, and makes it marshy,</l>
<l>And oft 'tis wont in summer to be sickly.</l>

<l>Passing that way the virgin pitiless</l>
<l>Land in the middle of the fen descried,</l>
<l>Untilled and naked of inhabitants;</l>

<l>There to escape all human intercourse,</l>
<l>She with her servants stayed, her arts to practise</l>
<l>And lived, and left her empty body there.</l>

<l>The men, thereafter, who were scattered round,</l>
<l>Collected in that place, which was made strong</l>
<l>By the lagoon it had on every side;</l>

<l>They built their city over those dead bones,</l>
<l>And, after her who first the place selected,</l>
<l>Mantua named it, without other omen.</l>

<l>Its people once within more crowded were,</l>
<l>Ere the stupidity of Casalodi</l>
<l>From Pinamonte had received deceit.</l>

<l>Therefore I caution thee, if e'er thou hearest</l>
<l>Originate my city otherwise,</l>
<l>No falsehood may the verity defraud."</l>

<l>And I: "My Master, thy discourses are</l>
<l>To me so certain, and so take my faith,</l>
<l>That unto me the rest would be spent coals.</l>

<l>But tell me of the people who are passing,</l>
<l>If any one note-worthy thou beholdest,</l>
<l>For only unto that my mind reverts."</l>

<l>Then said he to me: "He who from the cheek</l>
<l>Thrusts out his beard upon his swarthy shoulders</l>
<l>Was, at the time when Greece was void of males,</l>

<l>So that there scarce remained one in the cradle,</l>
<l>An augur, and with Calchas gave the moment,</l>
<l>In Aulis, when to sever the first cable.</l>

<l>Eryphylus his name was, and so sings</l>
<l>My lofty Tragedy in some part or other;</l>
<l>That knowest thou well, who knowest the whole of it.</l>

<l>The next, who is so slender in the flanks,</l>
<l>Was Michael Scott, who of a verity</l>
<l>Of magical illusions knew the game.</l>

<l>Behold Guido Bonatti, behold Asdente,</l>
<l>Who now unto his leather and his thread</l>
<l>Would fain have stuck, but he too late repents.</l>

<l>Behold the wretched ones, who left the needle,</l>
<l>The spool and rock, and made them fortune-tellers;</l>
<l>They wrought their magic spells with herb and image.</l>

<l>But come now, for already holds the confines</l>
<l>Of both the hemispheres, and under Seville</l>
<l>Touches the ocean-wave, Cain and the thorns,</l>

<l>And yesternight the moon was round already;</l>
<l>Thou shouldst remember well it did not harm thee</l>
<l>From time to time within the forest deep."</l>

<l>Thus spake he to me, and we walked the while.</l>

</canto>
<canto number="XXI">

<l>From bridge to bridge thus, speaking other things</l>
<l>Of which my Comedy cares not to sing,</l>
<l>We came along, and held the summit, when</l>

<l>We halted to behold another fissure</l>
<l>Of Malebolge and other vain laments;</l>
<l>And I beheld it marvellously dark.</l>

<l>As in the Arsenal of the Venetians</l>
<l>Boils in the winter the tenacious pitch</l>
<l>To smear their unsound vessels o'er again,</l>

<l>For sail they cannot; and instead thereof</l>
<l>One makes his vessel new, and one recaulks</l>
<l>The ribs of that which many a voyage has made;</l>

<l>One hammers at the prow, one at the stern,</l>
<l>This one makes oars, and that one cordage twists,</l>
<l>Another mends the mainsail and the mizzen;</l>

<l>Thus, not by fire, but by the art divine,</l>
<l>Was boiling down below there a dense pitch</l>
<l>Which upon every side the bank belimed.</l>

<l>I saw it, but I did not see within it</l>
<l>Aught but the bubbles that the boiling raised,</l>
<l>And all swell up and resubside compressed.</l>

<l>The while below there fixedly I gazed,</l>
<l>My Leader, crying out: "Beware, beware!"</l>
<l>Drew me unto himself from where I stood.</l>

<l>Then I turned round, as one who is impatient</l>
<l>To see what it behoves him to escape,</l>
<l>And whom a sudden terror doth unman,</l>

<l>Who, while he looks, delays not his departure;</l>
<l>And I beheld behind us a black devil,</l>
<l>Running along upon the crag, approach.</l>

<l>Ah, how ferocious was he in his aspect!</l>
<l>And how he seemed to me in action ruthless,</l>
<l>With open wings and light upon his feet!</l>

<l>His shoulders, which sharp-pointed were and high,</l>
<l>A sinner did encumber with both haunches,</l>
<l>And he held clutched the sinews of the feet.</l>

<l>From off our bridge, he said: "O Malebranche,</l>
<l>Behold one of the elders of Saint Zita;</l>
<l>Plunge him beneath, for I return for others</l>

<l>Unto that town, which is well furnished with them.</l>
<l>All there are barrators, except Bonturo;</l>
<l>No into Yes for money there is changed."</l>

<l>He hurled him down, and over the hard crag</l>
<l>Turned round, and never was a mastiff loosened</l>
<l>In so much hurry to pursue a thief.</l>

<l>The other sank, and rose again face downward;</l>
<l>But the demons, under cover of the bridge,</l>
<l>Cried: "Here the Santo Volto has no place!</l>

<l>Here swims one otherwise than in the Serchio;</l>
<l>Therefore, if for our gaffs thou wishest not,</l>
<l>Do not uplift thyself above the pitch."</l>

<l>They seized him then with more than a hundred rakes;</l>
<l>They said: "It here behoves thee to dance covered,</l>
<l>That, if thou canst, thou secretly mayest pilfer."</l>

<l>Not otherwise the cooks their scullions make</l>
<l>Immerse into the middle of the caldron</l>
<l>The meat with hooks, so that it may not float.</l>

<l>Said the good Master to me: "That it be not</l>
<l>Apparent thou art here, crouch thyself down</l>
<l>Behind a jag, that thou mayest have some screen;</l>

<l>And for no outrage that is done to me</l>
<l>Be thou afraid, because these things I know,</l>
<l>For once before was I in such a scuffle."</l>

<l>Then he passed on beyond the bridge's head,</l>
<l>And as upon the sixth bank he arrived,</l>
<l>Need was for him to have a steadfast front.</l>

<l>With the same fury, and the same uproar,</l>
<l>As dogs leap out upon a mendicant,</l>
<l>Who on a sudden begs, where'er he stops,</l>

<l>They issued from beneath the little bridge,</l>
<l>And turned against him all their grappling-irons;</l>
<l>But he cried out: "Be none of you malignant!</l>

<l>Before those hooks of yours lay hold of me,</l>
<l>Let one of you step forward, who may hear me,</l>
<l>And then take counsel as to grappling me."</l>

<l>They all cried out: "Let Malacoda go;"</l>
<l>Whereat one started, and the rest stood still,</l>
<l>And he came to him, saying: "What avails it?"</l>

<l>"Thinkest thou, Malacoda, to behold me</l>
<l>Advanced into this place," my Master said,</l>
<l>"Safe hitherto from all your skill of fence,</l>

<l>Without the will divine, and fate auspicious?</l>
<l>Let me go on, for it in Heaven is willed</l>
<l>That I another show this savage road."</l>

<l>Then was his arrogance so humbled in him,</l>
<l>That he let fall his grapnel at his feet,</l>
<l>And to the others said: "Now strike him not."</l>

<l>And unto me my Guide: "O thou, who sittest</l>
<l>Among the splinters of the bridge crouched down,</l>
<l>Securely now return to me again."</l>

<l>Wherefore I started and came swiftly to him;</l>
<l>And all the devils forward thrust themselves,</l>
<l>So that I feared they would not keep their compact.</l>

<l>And thus beheld I once afraid the soldiers</l>
<l>Who issued under safeguard from Caprona,</l>
<l>Seeing themselves among so many foes.</l>

<l>Close did I press myself with all my person</l>
<l>Beside my Leader, and turned not mine eyes</l>
<l>From off their countenance, which was not good.</l>

<l>They lowered their rakes, and "Wilt thou have me hit him,"</l>
<l>They said to one another, "on the rump?"</l>
<l>And answered: "Yes; see that thou nick him with it."</l>

<l>But the same demon who was holding parley</l>
<l>With my Conductor turned him very quickly,</l>
<l>And said: "Be quiet, be quiet, Scarmiglione;"</l>

<l>Then said to us: "You can no farther go</l>
<l>Forward upon this crag, because is lying</l>
<l>All shattered, at the bottom, the sixth arch.</l>

<l>And if it still doth please you to go onward,</l>
<l>Pursue your way along upon this rock;</l>
<l>Near is another crag that yields a path.</l>

<l>Yesterday, five hours later than this hour,</l>
<l>One thousand and two hundred sixty-six</l>
<l>Years were complete, that here the way was broken.</l>

<l>I send in that direction some of mine</l>
<l>To see if any one doth air himself;</l>
<l>Go ye with them; for they will not be vicious.</l>

<l>Step forward, Alichino and Calcabrina,"</l>
<l>Began he to cry out, "and thou, Cagnazzo;</l>
<l>And Barbariccia, do thou guide the ten.</l>

<l>Come forward, Libicocco and Draghignazzo,</l>
<l>And tusked Ciriatto and Graffiacane,</l>
<l>And Farfarello and mad Rubicante;</l>

<l>Search ye all round about the boiling pitch;</l>
<l>Let these be safe as far as the next crag,</l>
<l>That all unbroken passes o'er the dens."</l>

<l>"O me! what is it, Master, that I see?</l>
<l>Pray let us go," I said, "without an escort,</l>
<l>If thou knowest how, since for myself I ask none.</l>

<l>If thou art as observant as thy wont is,</l>
<l>Dost thou not see that they do gnash their teeth,</l>
<l>And with their brows are threatening woe to us?"</l>

<l>And he to me: "I will not have thee fear;</l>
<l>Let them gnash on, according to their fancy,</l>
<l>Because they do it for those boiling wretches."</l>

<l>Along the left-hand dike they wheeled about;</l>
<l>But first had each one thrust his tongue between</l>
<l>His teeth towards their leader for a signal;</l>

<l>And he had made a trumpet of his rump.</l>

<l>Vaunt-couriers have I seen upon your land,</l>
<l>O Aretines, and foragers go forth,</l>
<l>Tournaments stricken, and the joustings run,</l>

<l>Sometimes with trumpets and sometimes with bells,</l>
<l>With kettle-drums, and signals of the castles,</l>
<l>And with our own, and with outlandish things,</l>

<l>But never yet with bagpipe so uncouth</l>
<l>Did I see horsemen move, nor infantry,</l>
<l>Nor ship by any sign of land or star.</l>

<l>We went upon our way with the ten demons;</l>
<l>Ah, savage company! but in the church</l>
<l>With saints, and in the tavern with the gluttons!</l>

<l>Ever upon the pitch was my intent,</l>
<l>To see the whole condition of that Bolgia,</l>
<l>And of the people who therein were burned.</l>

<l>Even as the dolphins, when they make a sign</l>
<l>To mariners by arching of the back,</l>
<l>That they should counsel take to save their vessel,</l>

<l>Thus sometimes, to alleviate his pain,</l>
<l>One of the sinners would display his back,</l>
<l>And in less time conceal it than it lightens.</l>

<l>As on the brink of water in a ditch</l>
<l>The frogs stand only with their muzzles out,</l>
<l>So that they hide their feet and other bulk,</l>

<l>So upon every side the sinners stood;</l>
<l>But ever as Barbariccia near them came,</l>
<l>Thus underneath the boiling they withdrew.</l>

<l>I saw, and still my heart doth shudder at it,</l>
<l>One waiting thus, even as it comes to pass</l>
<l>One frog remains, and down another dives;</l>

<l>And Graffiacan, who most confronted him,</l>
<l>Grappled him by his tresses smeared with pitch,</l>
<l>And drew him up, so that he seemed an otter.</l>

<l>I knew, before, the names of all of them,</l>
<l>So had I noted them when they were chosen,</l>
<l>And when they called each other, listened how.</l>

<l>"O Rubicante, see that thou do lay</l>
<l>Thy claws upon him, so that thou mayst flay him,"</l>
<l>Cried all together the accursed ones.</l>

<l>And I: "My Master, see to it, if thou canst,</l>
<l>That thou mayst know who is the luckless wight,</l>
<l>Thus come into his adversaries' hands."</l>

<l>Near to the side of him my Leader drew,</l>
<l>Asked of him whence he was; and he replied:</l>
<l>"I in the kingdom of Navarre was born;</l>

<l>My mother placed me servant to a lord,</l>
<l>For she had borne me to a ribald knave,</l>
<l>Destroyer of himself and of his things.</l>

<l>Then I domestic was of good King Thibault;</l>
<l>I set me there to practise barratry,</l>
<l>For which I pay the reckoning in this heat."</l>

<l>And Ciriatto, from whose mouth projected,</l>
<l>On either side, a tusk, as in a boar,</l>
<l>Caused him to feel how one of them could rip.</l>

<l>Among malicious cats the mouse had come;</l>
<l>But Barbariccia clasped him in his arms,</l>
<l>And said: "Stand ye aside, while I enfork him."</l>

<l>And to my Master he turned round his head;</l>
<l>"Ask him again," he said, "if more thou wish</l>
<l>To know from him, before some one destroy him."</l>

<l>The Guide: "Now tell then of the other culprits;</l>
<l>Knowest thou any one who is a Latian,</l>
<l>Under the pitch?"  And he: "I separated</l>

<l>Lately from one who was a neighbour to it;</l>
<l>Would that I still were covered up with him,</l>
<l>For I should fear not either claw nor hook!"</l>

<l>And Libicocco: "We have borne too much;"</l>
<l>And with his grapnel seized him by the arm,</l>
<l>So that, by rending, he tore off a tendon.</l>

<l>Eke Draghignazzo wished to pounce upon him</l>
<l>Down at the legs; whence their Decurion</l>
<l>Turned round and round about with evil look.</l>

<l>When they again somewhat were pacified,</l>
<l>Of him, who still was looking at his wound,</l>
<l>Demanded my Conductor without stay:</l>

<l>"Who was that one, from whom a luckless parting</l>
<l>Thou sayest thou hast made, to come ashore?"</l>
<l>And he replied: "It was the Friar Gomita,</l>

<l>He of Gallura, vessel of all fraud,</l>
<l>Who had the enemies of his Lord in hand,</l>
<l>And dealt so with them each exults thereat;</l>

<l>Money he took, and let them smoothly off,</l>
<l>As he says; and in other offices</l>
<l>A barrator was he, not mean but sovereign.</l>

<l>Foregathers with him one Don Michael Zanche</l>
<l>Of Logodoro; and of Sardinia</l>
<l>To gossip never do their tongues feel tired.</l>

<l>O me! see that one, how he grinds his teeth;</l>
<l>Still farther would I speak, but am afraid</l>
<l>Lest he to scratch my itch be making ready."</l>

<l>And the grand Provost, turned to Farfarello,</l>
<l>Who rolled his eyes about as if to strike,</l>
<l>Said: "Stand aside there, thou malicious bird."</l>

<l>"If you desire either to see or hear,"</l>
<l>The terror-stricken recommenced thereon,</l>
<l>"Tuscans or Lombards, I will make them come.</l>

<l>But let the Malebranche cease a little,</l>
<l>So that these may not their revenges fear,</l>
<l>And I, down sitting in this very place,</l>

<l>For one that I am will make seven come,</l>
<l>When I shall whistle, as our custom is</l>
<l>To do whenever one of us comes out."</l>

<l>Cagnazzo at these words his muzzle lifted,</l>
<l>Shaking his head, and said: "Just hear the trick</l>
<l>Which he has thought of, down to throw himself!"</l>

<l>Whence he, who snares in great abundance had,</l>
<l>Responded: "I by far too cunning am,</l>
<l>When I procure for mine a greater sadness."</l>

<l>Alichin held not in, but running counter</l>
<l>Unto the rest, said to him: "If thou dive,</l>
<l>I will not follow thee upon the gallop,</l>

<l>But I will beat my wings above the pitch;</l>
<l>The height be left, and be the bank a shield</l>
<l>To see if thou alone dost countervail us."</l>

<l>O thou who readest, thou shalt hear new sport!</l>
<l>Each to the other side his eyes averted;</l>
<l>He first, who most reluctant was to do it.</l>

<l>The Navarrese selected well his time;</l>
<l>Planted his feet on land, and in a moment</l>
<l>Leaped, and released himself from their design.</l>

<l>Whereat each one was suddenly stung with shame,</l>
<l>But he most who was cause of the defeat;</l>
<l>Therefore he moved, and cried: "Thou art o'ertakern."</l>

<l>But little it availed, for wings could not</l>
<l>Outstrip the fear; the other one went under,</l>
<l>And, flying, upward he his breast directed;</l>

<l>Not otherwise the duck upon a sudden</l>
<l>Dives under, when the falcon is approaching,</l>
<l>And upward he returneth cross and weary.</l>

<l>Infuriate at the mockery, Calcabrina</l>
<l>Flying behind him followed close, desirous</l>
<l>The other should escape, to have a quarrel.</l>

<l>And when the barrator had disappeared,</l>
<l>He turned his talons upon his companion,</l>
<l>And grappled with him right above the moat.</l>

<l>But sooth the other was a doughty sparhawk</l>
<l>To clapperclaw him well; and both of them</l>
<l>Fell in the middle of the boiling pond.</l>

<l>A sudden intercessor was the heat;</l>
<l>But ne'ertheless of rising there was naught,</l>
<l>To such degree they had their wings belimed.</l>

<l>Lamenting with the others, Barbariccia</l>
<l>Made four of them fly to the other side</l>
<l>With all their gaffs, and very speedily</l>

<l>This side and that they to their posts descended;</l>
<l>They stretched their hooks towards the pitch-ensnared,</l>
<l>Who were already baked within the crust,</l>

<l>And in this manner busied did we leave them.</l>

</canto>
<canto number="XXIII">

<l>Silent, alone, and without company</l>
<l>We went, the one in front, the other after,</l>
<l>As go the Minor Friars along their way.</l>

<l>Upon the fable of Aesop was directed</l>
<l>My thought, by reason of the present quarrel,</l>
<l>Where he has spoken of the frog and mouse;</l>

<l>For 'mo' and 'issa' are not more alike</l>
<l>Than this one is to that, if well we couple</l>
<l>End and beginning with a steadfast mind.</l>

<l>And even as one thought from another springs,</l>
<l>So afterward from that was born another,</l>
<l>Which the first fear within me double made.</l>

<l>Thus did I ponder: "These on our account</l>
<l>Are laughed to scorn, with injury and scoff</l>
<l>So great, that much I think it must annoy them.</l>

<l>If anger be engrafted on ill-will,</l>
<l>They will come after us more merciless</l>
<l>Than dog upon the leveret which he seizes,"</l>

<l>I felt my hair stand all on end already</l>
<l>With terror, and stood backwardly intent,</l>
<l>When said I: "Master, if thou hidest not</l>

<l>Thyself and me forthwith, of Malebranche</l>
<l>I am in dread; we have them now behind us;</l>
<l>I so imagine them, I already feel them."</l>

<l>And he: "If I were made of leaded glass,</l>
<l>Thine outward image I should not attract</l>
<l>Sooner to me than I imprint the inner.</l>

<l>Just now thy thoughts came in among my own,</l>
<l>With similar attitude and similar face,</l>
<l>So that of both one counsel sole I made.</l>

<l>If peradventure the right bank so slope</l>
<l>That we to the next Bolgia can descend,</l>
<l>We shall escape from the imagined chase."</l>

<l>Not yet he finished rendering such opinion,</l>
<l>When I beheld them come with outstretched wings,</l>
<l>Not far remote, with will to seize upon us.</l>

<l>My Leader on a sudden seized me up,</l>
<l>Even as a mother who by noise is wakened,</l>
<l>And close beside her sees the enkindled flames,</l>

<l>Who takes her son, and flies, and does not stop,</l>
<l>Having more care of him than of herself,</l>
<l>So that she clothes her only with a shift;</l>

<l>And downward from the top of the hard bank</l>
<l>Supine he gave him to the pendent rock,</l>
<l>That one side of the other Bolgia walls.</l>

<l>Ne'er ran so swiftly water through a sluice</l>
<l>To turn the wheel of any land-built mill,</l>
<l>When nearest to the paddles it approaches,</l>

<l>As did my Master down along that border,</l>
<l>Bearing me with him on his breast away,</l>
<l>As his own son, and not as a companion.</l>

<l>Hardly the bed of the ravine below</l>
<l>His feet had reached, ere they had reached the hill</l>
<l>Right over us; but he was not afraid;</l>

<l>For the high Providence, which had ordained</l>
<l>To place them ministers of the fifth moat,</l>
<l>The power of thence departing took from all.</l>

<l>A painted people there below we found,</l>
<l>Who went about with footsteps very slow,</l>
<l>Weeping and in their semblance tired and vanquished.</l>

<l>They had on mantles with the hoods low down</l>
<l>Before their eyes, and fashioned of the cut</l>
<l>That in Cologne they for the monks are made.</l>

<l>Without, they gilded are so that it dazzles;</l>
<l>But inwardly all leaden and so heavy</l>
<l>That Frederick used to put them on of straw.</l>

<l>O everlastingly fatiguing mantle!</l>
<l>Again we turned us, still to the left hand</l>
<l>Along with them, intent on their sad plaint;</l>

<l>But owing to the weight, that weary folk</l>
<l>Came on so tardily, that we were new</l>
<l>In company at each motion of the haunch.</l>

<l>Whence I unto my Leader: "See thou find</l>
<l>Some one who may by deed or name be known,</l>
<l>And thus in going move thine eye about."</l>

<l>And one, who understood the Tuscan speech,</l>
<l>Cried to us from behind: "Stay ye your feet,</l>
<l>Ye, who so run athwart the dusky air!</l>

<l>Perhaps thou'lt have from me what thou demandest."</l>
<l>Whereat the Leader turned him, and said: "Wait,</l>
<l>And then according to his pace proceed."</l>

<l>I stopped, and two beheld I show great haste</l>
<l>Of spirit, in their faces, to be with me;</l>
<l>But the burden and the narrow way delayed them.</l>

<l>When they came up, long with an eye askance</l>
<l>They scanned me without uttering a word.</l>
<l>Then to each other turned, and said together:</l>

<l>"He by the action of his throat seems living;</l>
<l>And if they dead are, by what privilege</l>
<l>Go they uncovered by the heavy stole?"</l>

<l>Then said to me: "Tuscan, who to the college</l>
<l>Of miserable hypocrites art come,</l>
<l>Do not disdain to tell us who thou art."</l>

<l>And I to them: "Born was I, and grew up</l>
<l>In the great town on the fair river of Arno,</l>
<l>And with the body am I've always had.</l>

<l>But who are ye, in whom there trickles down</l>
<l>Along your cheeks such grief as I behold?</l>
<l>And what pain is upon you, that so sparkles?"</l>

<l>And one replied to me: "These orange cloaks</l>
<l>Are made of lead so heavy, that the weights</l>
<l>Cause in this way their balances to creak.</l>

<l>Frati Gaudenti were we, and Bolognese;</l>
<l>I Catalano, and he Loderingo</l>
<l>Named, and together taken by thy city,</l>

<l>As the wont is to take one man alone,</l>
<l>For maintenance of its peace; and we were such</l>
<l>That still it is apparent round Gardingo."</l>

<l>"O Friars," began I, "your iniquitous. . ."</l>
<l>But said no more; for to mine eyes there rushed</l>
<l>One crucified with three stakes on the ground.</l>

<l>When me he saw, he writhed himself all over,</l>
<l>Blowing into his beard with suspirations;</l>
<l>And the Friar Catalan, who noticed this,</l>

<l>Said to me: "This transfixed one, whom thou seest,</l>
<l>Counselled the Pharisees that it was meet</l>
<l>To put one man to torture for the people.</l>

<l>Crosswise and naked is he on the path,</l>
<l>As thou perceivest; and he needs must feel,</l>
<l>Whoever passes, first how much he weighs;</l>

<l>And in like mode his father-in-law is punished</l>
<l>Within this moat, and the others of the council,</l>
<l>Which for the Jews was a malignant seed."</l>

<l>And thereupon I saw Virgilius marvel</l>
<l>O'er him who was extended on the cross</l>
<l>So vilely in eternal banishment.</l>

<l>Then he directed to the Friar this voice:</l>
<l>"Be not displeased, if granted thee, to tell us</l>
<l>If to the right hand any pass slope down</l>

<l>By which we two may issue forth from here,</l>
<l>Without constraining some of the black angels</l>
<l>To come and extricate us from this deep."</l>

<l>Then he made answer: "Nearer than thou hopest</l>
<l>There is a rock, that forth from the great circle</l>
<l>Proceeds, and crosses all the cruel valleys,</l>

<l>Save that at this 'tis broken, and does not bridge it;</l>
<l>You will be able to mount up the ruin,</l>
<l>That sidelong slopes and at the bottom rises."</l>

<l>The Leader stood awhile with head bowed down;</l>
<l>Then said: "The business badly he recounted</l>
<l>Who grapples with his hook the sinners yonder."</l>

<l>And the Friar: "Many of the Devil's vices</l>
<l>Once heard I at Bologna, and among them,</l>
<l>That he's a liar and the father of lies."</l>

<l>Thereat my Leader with great strides went on,</l>
<l>Somewhat disturbed with anger in his looks;</l>
<l>Whence from the heavy-laden I departed</l>

<l>After the prints of his beloved feet.</l>

</canto>
<canto number="XXIV">

<l>In that part of the youthful year wherein</l>
<l>The Sun his locks beneath Aquarius tempers,</l>
<l>And now the nights draw near to half the day,</l>

<l>What time the hoar-frost copies on the ground</l>
<l>The outward semblance of her sister white,</l>
<l>But little lasts the temper of her pen,</l>

<l>The husbandman, whose forage faileth him,</l>
<l>Rises, and looks, and seeth the champaign</l>
<l>All gleaming white, whereat he beats his flank,</l>

<l>Returns in doors, and up and down laments,</l>
<l>Like a poor wretch, who knows not what to do;</l>
<l>Then he returns and hope revives again,</l>

<l>Seeing the world has changed its countenance</l>
<l>In little time, and takes his shepherd's crook,</l>
<l>And forth the little lambs to pasture drives.</l>

<l>Thus did the Master fill me with alarm,</l>
<l>When I beheld his forehead so disturbed,</l>
<l>And to the ailment came as soon the plaster.</l>

<l>For as we came unto the ruined bridge,</l>
<l>The Leader turned to me with that sweet look</l>
<l>Which at the mountain's foot I first beheld.</l>

<l>His arms he opened, after some advisement</l>
<l>Within himself elected, looking first</l>
<l>Well at the ruin, and laid hold of me.</l>

<l>And even as he who acts and meditates,</l>
<l>For aye it seems that he provides beforehand,</l>
<l>So upward lifting me towards the summit</l>

<l>Of a huge rock, he scanned another crag,</l>
<l>Saying: "To that one grapple afterwards,</l>
<l>But try first if 'tis such that it will hold thee."</l>

<l>This was no way for one clothed with a cloak;</l>
<l>For hardly we, he light, and I pushed upward,</l>
<l>Were able to ascend from jag to jag.</l>

<l>And had it not been, that upon that precinct</l>
<l>Shorter was the ascent than on the other,</l>
<l>He I know not, but I had been dead beat.</l>

<l>But because Malebolge tow'rds the mouth</l>
<l>Of the profoundest well is all inclining,</l>
<l>The structure of each valley doth import</l>

<l>That one bank rises and the other sinks.</l>
<l>Still we arrived at length upon the point</l>
<l>Wherefrom the last stone breaks itself asunder.</l>

<l>The breath was from my lungs so milked away,</l>
<l>When I was up, that I could go no farther,</l>
<l>Nay, I sat down upon my first arrival.</l>

<l>"Now it behoves thee thus to put off sloth,"</l>
<l>My Master said; "for sitting upon down,</l>
<l>Or under quilt, one cometh not to fame,</l>

<l>Withouten which whoso his life consumes</l>
<l>Such vestige leaveth of himself on earth,</l>
<l>As smoke in air or in the water foam.</l>

<l>And therefore raise thee up, o'ercome the anguish</l>
<l>With spirit that o'ercometh every battle,</l>
<l>If with its heavy body it sink not.</l>

<l>A longer stairway it behoves thee mount;</l>
<l>'Tis not enough from these to have departed;</l>
<l>Let it avail thee, if thou understand me."</l>

<l>Then I uprose, showing myself provided</l>
<l>Better with breath than I did feel myself,</l>
<l>And said: "Go on, for I am strong and bold."</l>

<l>Upward we took our way along the crag,</l>
<l>Which jagged was, and narrow, and difficult,</l>
<l>And more precipitous far than that before.</l>

<l>Speaking I went, not to appear exhausted;</l>
<l>Whereat a voice from the next moat came forth,</l>
<l>Not well adapted to articulate words.</l>

<l>I know not what it said, though o'er the back</l>
<l>I now was of the arch that passes there;</l>
<l>But he seemed moved to anger who was speaking.</l>

<l>I was bent downward, but my living eyes</l>
<l>Could not attain the bottom, for the dark;</l>
<l>Wherefore I: "Master, see that thou arrive</l>

<l>At the next round, and let us descend the wall;</l>
<l>For as from hence I hear and understand not,</l>
<l>So I look down and nothing I distinguish."</l>

<l>"Other response," he said, "I make thee not,</l>
<l>Except the doing; for the modest asking</l>
<l>Ought to be followed by the deed in silence."</l>

<l>We from the bridge descended at its head,</l>
<l>Where it connects itself with the eighth bank,</l>
<l>And then was manifest to me the Bolgia;</l>

<l>And I beheld therein a terrible throng</l>
<l>Of serpents, and of such a monstrous kind,</l>
<l>That the remembrance still congeals my blood</l>

<l>Let Libya boast no longer with her sand;</l>
<l>For if Chelydri, Jaculi, and Phareae</l>
<l>She breeds, with Cenchri and with Amphisbaena,</l>

<l>Neither so many plagues nor so malignant</l>
<l>E'er showed she with all Ethiopia,</l>
<l>Nor with whatever on the Red Sea is!</l>

<l>Among this cruel and most dismal throng</l>
<l>People were running naked and affrighted.</l>
<l>Without the hope of hole or heliotrope.</l>

<l>They had their hands with serpents bound behind them;</l>
<l>These riveted upon their reins the tail</l>
<l>And head, and were in front of them entwined.</l>

<l>And lo! at one who was upon our side</l>
<l>There darted forth a serpent, which transfixed him</l>
<l>There where the neck is knotted to the shoulders.</l>

<l>Nor 'O' so quickly e'er, nor 'I' was written,</l>
<l>As he took fire, and burned; and ashes wholly</l>
<l>Behoved it that in falling he became.</l>

<l>And when he on the ground was thus destroyed,</l>
<l>The ashes drew together, and of themselves</l>
<l>Into himself they instantly returned.</l>

<l>Even thus by the great sages 'tis confessed</l>
<l>The phoenix dies, and then is born again,</l>
<l>When it approaches its five-hundredth year;</l>

<l>On herb or grain it feeds not in its life,</l>
<l>But only on tears of incense and amomum,</l>
<l>And nard and myrrh are its last winding-sheet.</l>

<l>And as he is who falls, and knows not how,</l>
<l>By force of demons who to earth down drag him,</l>
<l>Or other oppilation that binds man,</l>

<l>When he arises and around him looks,</l>
<l>Wholly bewildered by the mighty anguish</l>
<l>Which he has suffered, and in looking sighs;</l>

<l>Such was that sinner after he had risen.</l>
<l>Justice of God! O how severe it is,</l>
<l>That blows like these in vengeance poureth down!</l>

<l>The Guide thereafter asked him who he was;</l>
<l>Whence he replied: "I rained from Tuscany</l>
<l>A short time since into this cruel gorge.</l>

<l>A bestial life, and not a human, pleased me,</l>
<l>Even as the mule I was; I'm Vanni Fucci,</l>
<l>Beast, and Pistoia was my worthy den."</l>

<l>And I unto the Guide: "Tell him to stir not,</l>
<l>And ask what crime has thrust him here below,</l>
<l>For once a man of blood and wrath I saw him."</l>

<l>And the sinner, who had heard, dissembled not,</l>
<l>But unto me directed mind and face,</l>
<l>And with a melancholy shame was painted.</l>

<l>Then said: "It pains me more that thou hast caught me</l>
<l>Amid this misery where thou seest me,</l>
<l>Than when I from the other life was taken.</l>

<l>What thou demandest I cannot deny;</l>
<l>So low am I put down because I robbed</l>
<l>The sacristy of the fair ornaments,</l>

<l>And falsely once 'twas laid upon another;</l>
<l>But that thou mayst not such a sight enjoy,</l>
<l>If thou shalt e'er be out of the dark places,</l>

<l>Thine ears to my announcement ope and hear:</l>
<l>Pistoia first of Neri groweth meagre;</l>
<l>Then Florence doth renew her men and manners;</l>

<l>Mars draws a vapour up from Val di Magra,</l>
<l>Which is with turbid clouds enveloped round,</l>
<l>And with impetuous and bitter tempest</l>

<l>Over Campo Picen shall be the battle;</l>
<l>When it shall suddenly rend the mist asunder,</l>
<l>So that each Bianco shall thereby be smitten.</l>

<l>And this I've said that it may give thee pain."</l>

</canto>
<canto number="XXV">

<l>At the conclusion of his words, the thief</l>
<l>Lifted his hands aloft with both the figs,</l>
<l>Crying: "Take that, God, for at thee I aim them."</l>

<l>From that time forth the serpents were my friends;</l>
<l>For one entwined itself about his neck</l>
<l>As if it said: "I will not thou speak more;"</l>

<l>And round his arms another, and rebound him,</l>
<l>Clinching itself together so in front,</l>
<l>That with them he could not a motion make.</l>

<l>Pistoia, ah, Pistoia! why resolve not</l>
<l>To burn thyself to ashes and so perish,</l>
<l>Since in ill-doing thou thy seed excellest?</l>

<l>Through all the sombre circles of this Hell,</l>
<l>Spirit I saw not against God so proud,</l>
<l>Not he who fell at Thebes down from the walls!</l>

<l>He fled away, and spake no further word;</l>
<l>And I beheld a Centaur full of rage</l>
<l>Come crying out: "Where is, where is the scoffer?"</l>

<l>I do not think Maremma has so many</l>
<l>Serpents as he had all along his back,</l>
<l>As far as where our countenance begins.</l>

<l>Upon the shoulders, just behind the nape,</l>
<l>With wings wide open was a dragon lying,</l>
<l>And he sets fire to all that he encounters.</l>

<l>My Master said: "That one is Cacus, who</l>
<l>Beneath the rock upon Mount Aventine</l>
<l>Created oftentimes a lake of blood.</l>

<l>He goes not on the same road with his brothers,</l>
<l>By reason of the fraudulent theft he made</l>
<l>Of the great herd, which he had near to him;</l>

<l>Whereat his tortuous actions ceased beneath</l>
<l>The mace of Hercules, who peradventure</l>
<l>Gave him a hundred, and he felt not ten."</l>

<l>While he was speaking thus, he had passed by,</l>
<l>And spirits three had underneath us come,</l>
<l>Of which nor I aware was, nor my Leader,</l>

<l>Until what time they shouted: "Who are you?"</l>
<l>On which account our story made a halt,</l>
<l>And then we were intent on them alone.</l>

<l>I did not know them; but it came to pass,</l>
<l>As it is wont to happen by some chance,</l>
<l>That one to name the other was compelled,</l>

<l>Exclaiming: "Where can Cianfa have remained?"</l>
<l>Whence I, so that the Leader might attend,</l>
<l>Upward from chin to nose my finger laid.</l>

<l>If thou art, Reader, slow now to believe</l>
<l>What I shall say, it will no marvel be,</l>
<l>For I who saw it hardly can admit it.</l>

<l>As I was holding raised on them my brows,</l>
<l>Behold! a serpent with six feet darts forth</l>
<l>In front of one, and fastens wholly on him.</l>

<l>With middle feet it bound him round the paunch,</l>
<l>And with the forward ones his arms it seized;</l>
<l>Then thrust its teeth through one cheek and the other;</l>

<l>The hindermost it stretched upon his thighs,</l>
<l>And put its tail through in between the two,</l>
<l>And up behind along the reins outspread it.</l>

<l>Ivy was never fastened by its barbs</l>
<l>Unto a tree so, as this horrible reptile</l>
<l>Upon the other's limbs entwined its own.</l>

<l>Then they stuck close, as if of heated wax</l>
<l>They had been made, and intermixed their colour;</l>
<l>Nor one nor other seemed now what he was;</l>

<l>E'en as proceedeth on before the flame</l>
<l>Upward along the paper a brown colour,</l>
<l>Which is not black as yet, and the white dies.</l>

<l>The other two looked on, and each of them</l>
<l>Cried out: "O me, Agnello, how thou changest!</l>
<l>Behold, thou now art neither two nor one."</l>

<l>Already the two heads had one become,</l>
<l>When there appeared to us two figures mingled</l>
<l>Into one face, wherein the two were lost.</l>

<l>Of the four lists were fashioned the two arms,</l>
<l>The thighs and legs, the belly and the chest</l>
<l>Members became that never yet were seen.</l>

<l>Every original aspect there was cancelled;</l>
<l>Two and yet none did the perverted image</l>
<l>Appear, and such departed with slow pace.</l>

<l>Even as a lizard, under the great scourge</l>
<l>Of days canicular, exchanging hedge,</l>
<l>Lightning appeareth if the road it cross;</l>

<l>Thus did appear, coming towards the bellies</l>
<l>Of the two others, a small fiery serpent,</l>
<l>Livid and black as is a peppercorn.</l>

<l>And in that part whereat is first received</l>
<l>Our aliment, it one of them transfixed;</l>
<l>Then downward fell in front of him extended.</l>

<l>The one transfixed looked at it, but said naught;</l>
<l>Nay, rather with feet motionless he yawned,</l>
<l>Just as if sleep or fever had assailed him.</l>

<l>He at the serpent gazed, and it at him;</l>
<l>One through the wound, the other through the mouth</l>
<l>Smoked violently, and the smoke commingled.</l>

<l>Henceforth be silent Lucan, where he mentions</l>
<l>Wretched Sabellus and Nassidius,</l>
<l>And wait to hear what now shall be shot forth.</l>

<l>Be silent Ovid, of Cadmus and Arethusa;</l>
<l>For if him to a snake, her to fountain,</l>
<l>Converts he fabling, that I grudge him not;</l>

<l>Because two natures never front to front</l>
<l>Has he transmuted, so that both the forms</l>
<l>To interchange their matter ready were.</l>

<l>Together they responded in such wise,</l>
<l>That to a fork the serpent cleft his tail,</l>
<l>And eke the wounded drew his feet together.</l>

<l>The legs together with the thighs themselves</l>
<l>Adhered so, that in little time the juncture</l>
<l>No sign whatever made that was apparent.</l>

<l>He with the cloven tail assumed the figure</l>
<l>The other one was losing, and his skin</l>
<l>Became elastic, and the other's hard.</l>

<l>I saw the arms draw inward at the armpits,</l>
<l>And both feet of the reptile, that were short,</l>
<l>Lengthen as much as those contracted were.</l>

<l>Thereafter the hind feet, together twisted,</l>
<l>Became the member that a man conceals,</l>
<l>And of his own the wretch had two created.</l>

<l>While both of them the exhalation veils</l>
<l>With a new colour, and engenders hair</l>
<l>On one of them and depilates the other,</l>

<l>The one uprose and down the other fell,</l>
<l>Though turning not away their impious lamps,</l>
<l>Underneath which each one his muzzle changed.</l>

<l>He who was standing drew it tow'rds the temples,</l>
<l>And from excess of matter, which came thither,</l>
<l>Issued the ears from out the hollow cheeks;</l>

<l>What did not backward run and was retained</l>
<l>Of that excess made to the face a nose,</l>
<l>And the lips thickened far as was befitting.</l>

<l>He who lay prostrate thrusts his muzzle forward,</l>
<l>And backward draws the ears into his head,</l>
<l>In the same manner as the snail its horns;</l>

<l>And so the tongue, which was entire and apt</l>
<l>For speech before, is cleft, and the bi-forked</l>
<l>In the other closes up, and the smoke ceases.</l>

<l>The soul, which to a reptile had been changed,</l>
<l>Along the valley hissing takes to flight,</l>
<l>And after him the other speaking sputters.</l>

<l>Then did he turn upon him his new shoulders,</l>
<l>And said to the other: "I'll have Buoso run,</l>
<l>Crawling as I have done, along this road."</l>

<l>In this way I beheld the seventh ballast</l>
<l>Shift and reshift, and here be my excuse</l>
<l>The novelty, if aught my pen transgress.</l>

<l>And notwithstanding that mine eyes might be</l>
<l>Somewhat bewildered, and my mind dismayed,</l>
<l>They could not flee away so secretly</l>

<l>But that I plainly saw Puccio Sciancato;</l>
<l>And he it was who sole of three companions,</l>
<l>Which came in the beginning, was not changed;</l>

<l>The other was he whom thou, Gaville, weepest.</l>

</canto>
<canto number="XXVI">

<l>Rejoice, O Florence, since thou art so great,</l>
<l>That over sea and land thou beatest thy wings,</l>
<l>And throughout Hell thy name is spread abroad!</l>

<l>Among the thieves five citizens of thine</l>
<l>Like these I found, whence shame comes unto me,</l>
<l>And thou thereby to no great honour risest.</l>

<l>But if when morn is near our dreams are true,</l>
<l>Feel shalt thou in a little time from now</l>
<l>What Prato, if none other, craves for thee.</l>

<l>And if it now were, it were not too soon;</l>
<l>Would that it were, seeing it needs must be,</l>
<l>For 'twill aggrieve me more the more I age.</l>

<l>We went our way, and up along the stairs</l>
<l>The bourns had made us to descend before,</l>
<l>Remounted my Conductor and drew me.</l>

<l>And following the solitary path</l>
<l>Among the rocks and ridges of the crag,</l>
<l>The foot without the hand sped not at all.</l>

<l>Then sorrowed I, and sorrow now again,</l>
<l>When I direct my mind to what I saw,</l>
<l>And more my genius curb than I am wont,</l>

<l>That it may run not unless virtue guide it;</l>
<l>So that if some good star, or better thing,</l>
<l>Have given me good, I may myself not grudge it.</l>

<l>As many as the hind (who on the hill</l>
<l>Rests at the time when he who lights the world</l>
<l>His countenance keeps least concealed from us,</l>

<l>While as the fly gives place unto the gnat)</l>
<l>Seeth the glow-worms down along the valley,</l>
<l>Perchance there where he ploughs and makes his vintage;</l>

<l>With flames as manifold resplendent all</l>
<l>Was the eighth Bolgia, as I grew aware</l>
<l>As soon as I was where the depth appeared.</l>

<l>And such as he who with the bears avenged him</l>
<l>Beheld Elijah's chariot at departing,</l>
<l>What time the steeds to heaven erect uprose,</l>

<l>For with his eye he could not follow it</l>
<l>So as to see aught else than flame alone,</l>
<l>Even as a little cloud ascending upward,</l>

<l>Thus each along the gorge of the intrenchment</l>
<l>Was moving; for not one reveals the theft,</l>
<l>And every flame a sinner steals away.</l>

<l>I stood upon the bridge uprisen to see,</l>
<l>So that, if I had seized not on a rock,</l>
<l>Down had I fallen without being pushed.</l>

<l>And the Leader, who beheld me so attent,</l>
<l>Exclaimed: "Within the fires the spirits are;</l>
<l>Each swathes himself with that wherewith he burns."</l>

<l>"My Master," I replied, "by hearing thee</l>
<l>I am more sure; but I surmised already</l>
<l>It might be so, and already wished to ask thee</l>

<l>Who is within that fire, which comes so cleft</l>
<l>At top, it seems uprising from the pyre</l>
<l>Where was Eteocles with his brother placed."</l>

<l>He answered me: "Within there are tormented</l>
<l>Ulysses and Diomed, and thus together</l>
<l>They unto vengeance run as unto wrath.</l>

<l>And there within their flame do they lament</l>
<l>The ambush of the horse, which made the door</l>
<l>Whence issued forth the Romans' gentle seed;</l>

<l>Therein is wept the craft, for which being dead</l>
<l>Deidamia still deplores Achilles,</l>
<l>And pain for the Palladium there is borne."</l>

<l>"If they within those sparks possess the power</l>
<l>To speak," I said, "thee, Master, much I pray,</l>
<l>And re-pray, that the prayer be worth a thousand,</l>

<l>That thou make no denial of awaiting</l>
<l>Until the horned flame shall hither come;</l>
<l>Thou seest that with desire I lean towards it."</l>

<l>And he to me: "Worthy is thy entreaty</l>
<l>Of much applause, and therefore I accept it;</l>
<l>But take heed that thy tongue restrain itself.</l>

<l>Leave me to speak, because I have conceived</l>
<l>That which thou wishest; for they might disdain</l>
<l>Perchance, since they were Greeks, discourse of thine."</l>

<l>When now the flame had come unto that point,</l>
<l>Where to my Leader it seemed time and place,</l>
<l>After this fashion did I hear him speak:</l>

<l>"O ye, who are twofold within one fire,</l>
<l>If I deserved of you, while I was living,</l>
<l>If I deserved of you or much or little</l>

<l>When in the world I wrote the lofty verses,</l>
<l>Do not move on, but one of you declare</l>
<l>Whither, being lost, he went away to die."</l>

<l>Then of the antique flame the greater horn,</l>
<l>Murmuring, began to wave itself about</l>
<l>Even as a flame doth which the wind fatigues.</l>

<l>Thereafterward, the summit to and fro</l>
<l>Moving as if it were the tongue that spake,</l>
<l>It uttered forth a voice, and said: "When I</l>

<l>From Circe had departed, who concealed me</l>
<l>More than a year there near unto Gaeta,</l>
<l>Or ever yet Aeneas named it so,</l>

<l>Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence</l>
<l>For my old father, nor the due affection</l>
<l>Which joyous should have made Penelope,</l>

<l>Could overcome within me the desire</l>
<l>I had to be experienced of the world,</l>
<l>And of the vice and virtue of mankind;</l>

<l>But I put forth on the high open sea</l>
<l>With one sole ship, and that small company</l>
<l>By which I never had deserted been.</l>

<l>Both of the shores I saw as far as Spain,</l>
<l>Far as Morocco, and the isle of Sardes,</l>
<l>And the others which that sea bathes round about.</l>

<l>I and my company were old and slow</l>
<l>When at that narrow passage we arrived</l>
<l>Where Hercules his landmarks set as signals,</l>

<l>That man no farther onward should adventure.</l>
<l>On the right hand behind me left I Seville,</l>
<l>And on the other already had left Ceuta.</l>

<l>'O brothers, who amid a hundred thousand</l>
<l>Perils,' I said, 'have come unto the West,</l>
<l>To this so inconsiderable vigil</l>

<l>Which is remaining of your senses still</l>
<l>Be ye unwilling to deny the knowledge,</l>
<l>Following the sun, of the unpeopled world.</l>

<l>Consider ye the seed from which ye sprang;</l>
<l>Ye were not made to live like unto brutes,</l>
<l>But for pursuit of virtue and of knowledge.'</l>

<l>So eager did I render my companions,</l>
<l>With this brief exhortation, for the voyage,</l>
<l>That then I hardly could have held them back.</l>

<l>And having turned our stern unto the morning,</l>
<l>We of the oars made wings for our mad flight,</l>
<l>Evermore gaining on the larboard side.</l>

<l>Already all the stars of the other pole</l>
<l>The night beheld, and ours so very low</l>
<l>It did not rise above the ocean floor.</l>

<l>Five times rekindled and as many quenched</l>
<l>Had been the splendour underneath the moon,</l>
<l>Since we had entered into the deep pass,</l>

<l>When there appeared to us a mountain, dim</l>
<l>From distance, and it seemed to me so high</l>
<l>As I had never any one beheld.</l>

<l>Joyful were we, and soon it turned to weeping;</l>
<l>For out of the new land a whirlwind rose,</l>
<l>And smote upon the fore part of the ship.</l>

<l>Three times it made her whirl with all the waters,</l>
<l>At the fourth time it made the stern uplift,</l>
<l>And the prow downward go, as pleased Another,</l>

<l>Until the sea above us closed again."</l>

</canto>
<canto number="XXVII">

<l>Already was the flame erect and quiet,</l>
<l>To speak no more, and now departed from us</l>
<l>With the permission of the gentle Poet;</l>

<l>When yet another, which behind it came,</l>
<l>Caused us to turn our eyes upon its top</l>
<l>By a confused sound that issued from it.</l>

<l>As the Sicilian bull (that bellowed first</l>
<l>With the lament of him, and that was right,</l>
<l>Who with his file had modulated it)</l>

<l>Bellowed so with the voice of the afflicted,</l>
<l>That, notwithstanding it was made of brass,</l>
<l>Still it appeared with agony transfixed;</l>

<l>Thus, by not having any way or issue</l>
<l>At first from out the fire, to its own language</l>
<l>Converted were the melancholy words.</l>

<l>But afterwards, when they had gathered way</l>
<l>Up through the point, giving it that vibration</l>
<l>The tongue had given them in their passage out,</l>

<l>We heard it said: "O thou, at whom I aim</l>
<l>My voice, and who but now wast speaking Lombard,</l>
<l>Saying, 'Now go thy way, no more I urge thee,'</l>

<l>Because I come perchance a little late,</l>
<l>To stay and speak with me let it not irk thee;</l>
<l>Thou seest it irks not me, and I am burning.</l>

<l>If thou but lately into this blind world</l>
<l>Hast fallen down from that sweet Latian land,</l>
<l>Wherefrom I bring the whole of my transgression,</l>

<l>Say, if the Romagnuols have peace or war,</l>
<l>For I was from the mountains there between</l>
<l>Urbino and the yoke whence Tiber bursts."</l>

<l>I still was downward bent and listening,</l>
<l>When my Conductor touched me on the side,</l>
<l>Saying: "Speak thou: this one a Latian is."</l>

<l>And I, who had beforehand my reply</l>
<l>In readiness, forthwith began to speak:</l>
<l>"O soul, that down below there art concealed,</l>

<l>Romagna thine is not and never has been</l>
<l>Without war in the bosom of its tyrants;</l>
<l>But open war I none have left there now.</l>

<l>Ravenna stands as it long years has stood;</l>
<l>The Eagle of Polenta there is brooding,</l>
<l>So that she covers Cervia with her vans.</l>

<l>The city which once made the long resistance,</l>
<l>And of the French a sanguinary heap,</l>
<l>Beneath the Green Paws finds itself again;</l>

<l>Verrucchio's ancient Mastiff and the new,</l>
<l>Who made such bad disposal of Montagna,</l>
<l>Where they are wont make wimbles of their teeth.</l>

<l>The cities of Lamone and Santerno</l>
<l>Governs the Lioncel of the white lair,</l>
<l>Who changes sides 'twixt summer-time and winter;</l>

<l>And that of which the Savio bathes the flank,</l>
<l>Even as it lies between the plain and mountain,</l>
<l>Lives between tyranny and a free state.</l>

<l>Now I entreat thee tell us who thou art;</l>
<l>Be not more stubborn than the rest have been,</l>
<l>So may thy name hold front there in the world."</l>

<l>After the fire a little more had roared</l>
<l>In its own fashion, the sharp point it moved</l>
<l>This way and that, and then gave forth such breath:</l>

<l>"If I believed that my reply were made</l>
<l>To one who to the world would e'er return,</l>
<l>This flame without more flickering would stand still;</l>

<l>But inasmuch as never from this depth</l>
<l>Did any one return, if I hear true,</l>
<l>Without the fear of infamy I answer,</l>

<l>I was a man of arms, then Cordelier,</l>
<l>Believing thus begirt to make amends;</l>
<l>And truly my belief had been fulfilled</l>

<l>But for the High Priest, whom may ill betide,</l>
<l>Who put me back into my former sins;</l>
<l>And how and wherefore I will have thee hear.</l>

<l>While I was still the form of bone and pulp</l>
<l>My mother gave to me, the deeds I did</l>
<l>Were not those of a lion, but a fox.</l>

<l>The machinations and the covert ways</l>
<l>I knew them all, and practised so their craft,</l>
<l>That to the ends of earth the sound went forth.</l>

<l>When now unto that portion of mine age</l>
<l>I saw myself arrived, when each one ought</l>
<l>To lower the sails, and coil away the ropes,</l>

<l>That which before had pleased me then displeased me;</l>
<l>And penitent and confessing I surrendered,</l>
<l>Ah woe is me! and it would have bestead me;</l>

<l>The Leader of the modern Pharisees</l>
<l>Having a war near unto Lateran,</l>
<l>And not with Saracens nor with the Jews,</l>

<l>For each one of his enemies was Christian,</l>
<l>And none of them had been to conquer Acre,</l>
<l>Nor merchandising in the Sultan's land,</l>

<l>Nor the high office, nor the sacred orders,</l>
<l>In him regarded, nor in me that cord</l>
<l>Which used to make those girt with it more meagre;</l>

<l>But even as Constantine sought out Sylvester</l>
<l>To cure his leprosy, within Soracte,</l>
<l>So this one sought me out as an adept</l>

<l>To cure him of the fever of his pride.</l>
<l>Counsel he asked of me, and I was silent,</l>
<l>Because his words appeared inebriate.</l>

<l>And then he said: 'Be not thy heart afraid;</l>
<l>Henceforth I thee absolve; and thou instruct me</l>
<l>How to raze Palestrina to the ground.</l>

<l>Heaven have I power to lock and to unlock,</l>
<l>As thou dost know; therefore the keys are two,</l>
<l>The which my predecessor held not dear.'</l>

<l>Then urged me on his weighty arguments</l>
<l>There, where my silence was the worst advice;</l>
<l>And said I: 'Father, since thou washest me</l>

<l>Of that sin into which I now must fall,</l>
<l>The promise long with the fulfilment short</l>
<l>Will make thee triumph in thy lofty seat.'</l>

<l>Francis came afterward, when I was dead,</l>
<l>For me; but one of the black Cherubim</l>
<l>Said to him: 'Take him not; do me no wrong;</l>

<l>He must come down among my servitors,</l>
<l>Because he gave the fraudulent advice</l>
<l>From which time forth I have been at his hair;</l>

<l>For who repents not cannot be absolved,</l>
<l>Nor can one both repent and will at once,</l>
<l>Because of the contradiction which consents not.'</l>

<l>O miserable me! how I did shudder</l>
<l>When he seized on me, saying: 'Peradventure</l>
<l>Thou didst not think that I was a logician!'</l>

<l>He bore me unto Minos, who entwined</l>
<l>Eight times his tail about his stubborn back,</l>
<l>And after he had bitten it in great rage,</l>

<l>Said: 'Of the thievish fire a culprit this;'</l>
<l>Wherefore, here where thou seest, am I lost,</l>
<l>And vested thus in going I bemoan me."</l>

<l>When it had thus completed its recital,</l>
<l>The flame departed uttering lamentations,</l>
<l>Writhing and flapping its sharp-pointed horn.</l>

<l>Onward we passed, both I and my Conductor,</l>
<l>Up o'er the crag above another arch,</l>
<l>Which the moat covers, where is paid the fee</l>

<l>By those who, sowing discord, win their burden.</l>

</canto>
<canto number="XXVIII">

<l>Who ever could, e'en with untrammelled words,</l>
<l>Tell of the blood and of the wounds in full</l>
<l>Which now I saw, by many times narrating?</l>

<l>Each tongue would for a certainty fall short</l>
<l>By reason of our speech and memory,</l>
<l>That have small room to comprehend so much.</l>

<l>If were again assembled all the people</l>
<l>Which formerly upon the fateful land</l>
<l>Of Puglia were lamenting for their blood</l>

<l>Shed by the Romans and the lingering war</l>
<l>That of the rings made such illustrious spoils,</l>
<l>As Livy has recorded, who errs not,</l>

<l>With those who felt the agony of blows</l>
<l>By making counterstand to Robert Guiscard,</l>
<l>And all the rest, whose bones are gathered still</l>

<l>At Ceperano, where a renegade</l>
<l>Was each Apulian, and at Tagliacozzo,</l>
<l>Where without arms the old Alardo conquered,</l>

<l>And one his limb transpierced, and one lopped off,</l>
<l>Should show, it would be nothing to compare</l>
<l>With the disgusting mode of the ninth Bolgia.</l>

<l>A cask by losing centre-piece or cant</l>
<l>Was never shattered so, as I saw one</l>
<l>Rent from the chin to where one breaketh wind.</l>

<l>Between his legs were hanging down his entrails;</l>
<l>His heart was visible, and the dismal sack</l>
<l>That maketh excrement of what is eaten.</l>

<l>While I was all absorbed in seeing him,</l>
<l>He looked at me, and opened with his hands</l>
<l>His bosom, saying: "See now how I rend me;</l>

<l>How mutilated, see, is Mahomet;</l>
<l>In front of me doth Ali weeping go,</l>
<l>Cleft in the face from forelock unto chin;</l>

<l>And all the others whom thou here beholdest,</l>
<l>Disseminators of scandal and of schism</l>
<l>While living were, and therefore are cleft thus.</l>

<l>A devil is behind here, who doth cleave us</l>
<l>Thus cruelly, unto the falchion's edge</l>
<l>Putting again each one of all this ream,</l>

<l>When we have gone around the doleful road;</l>
<l>By reason that our wounds are closed again</l>
<l>Ere any one in front of him repass.</l>

<l>But who art thou, that musest on the crag,</l>
<l>Perchance to postpone going to the pain</l>
<l>That is adjudged upon thine accusations?"</l>

<l>"Nor death hath reached him yet, nor guilt doth bring him,"</l>
<l>My Master made reply, "to be tormented;</l>
<l>But to procure him full experience,</l>

<l>Me, who am dead, behoves it to conduct him</l>
<l>Down here through Hell, from circle unto circle;</l>
<l>And this is true as that I speak to thee."</l>

<l>More than a hundred were there when they heard him,</l>
<l>Who in the moat stood still to look at me,</l>
<l>Through wonderment oblivious of their torture.</l>

<l>"Now say to Fra Dolcino, then, to arm him,</l>
<l>Thou, who perhaps wilt shortly see the sun,</l>
<l>If soon he wish not here to follow me,</l>

<l>So with provisions, that no stress of snow</l>
<l>May give the victory to the Novarese,</l>
<l>Which otherwise to gain would not be easy."</l>

<l>After one foot to go away he lifted,</l>
<l>This word did Mahomet say unto me,</l>
<l>Then to depart upon the ground he stretched it.</l>

<l>Another one, who had his throat pierced through,</l>
<l>And nose cut off close underneath the brows,</l>
<l>And had no longer but a single ear,</l>

<l>Staying to look in wonder with the others,</l>
<l>Before the others did his gullet open,</l>
<l>Which outwardly was red in every part,</l>

<l>And said: "O thou, whom guilt doth not condemn,</l>
<l>And whom I once saw up in Latian land,</l>
<l>Unless too great similitude deceive me,</l>

<l>Call to remembrance Pier da Medicina,</l>
<l>If e'er thou see again the lovely plain</l>
<l>That from Vercelli slopes to Marcabo,</l>

<l>And make it known to the best two of Fano,</l>
<l>To Messer Guido and Angiolello likewise,</l>
<l>That if foreseeing here be not in vain,</l>

<l>Cast over from their vessel shall they be,</l>
<l>And drowned near unto the Cattolica,</l>
<l>By the betrayal of a tyrant fell.</l>

<l>Between the isles of Cyprus and Majorca</l>
<l>Neptune ne'er yet beheld so great a crime,</l>
<l>Neither of pirates nor Argolic people.</l>

<l>That traitor, who sees only with one eye,</l>
<l>And holds the land, which some one here with me</l>
<l>Would fain be fasting from the vision of,</l>

<l>Will make them come unto a parley with him;</l>
<l>Then will do so, that to Focara's wind</l>
<l>They will not stand in need of vow or prayer."</l>

<l>And I to him: "Show to me and declare,</l>
<l>If thou wouldst have me bear up news of thee,</l>
<l>Who is this person of the bitter vision."</l>

<l>Then did he lay his hand upon the jaw</l>
<l>Of one of his companions, and his mouth</l>
<l>Oped, crying: "This is he, and he speaks not.</l>

<l>This one, being banished, every doubt submerged</l>
<l>In Caesar by affirming the forearmed</l>
<l>Always with detriment allowed delay."</l>

<l>O how bewildered unto me appeared,</l>
<l>With tongue asunder in his windpipe slit,</l>
<l>Curio, who in speaking was so bold!</l>

<l>And one, who both his hands dissevered had,</l>
<l>The stumps uplifting through the murky air,</l>
<l>So that the blood made horrible his face,</l>

<l>Cried out: "Thou shalt remember Mosca also,</l>
<l>Who said, alas! 'A thing done has an end!'</l>
<l>Which was an ill seed for the Tuscan people."</l>

<l>"And death unto thy race," thereto I added;</l>
<l>Whence he, accumulating woe on woe,</l>
<l>Departed, like a person sad and crazed.</l>

<l>But I remained to look upon the crowd;</l>
<l>And saw a thing which I should be afraid,</l>
<l>Without some further proof, even to recount,</l>

<l>If it were not that conscience reassures me,</l>
<l>That good companion which emboldens man</l>
<l>Beneath the hauberk of its feeling pure.</l>

<l>I truly saw, and still I seem to see it,</l>
<l>A trunk without a head walk in like manner</l>
<l>As walked the others of the mournful herd.</l>

<l>And by the hair it held the head dissevered,</l>
<l>Hung from the hand in fashion of a lantern,</l>
<l>And that upon us gazed and said: "O me!"</l>

<l>It of itself made to itself a lamp,</l>
<l>And they were two in one, and one in two;</l>
<l>How that can be, He knows who so ordains it.</l>

<l>When it was come close to the bridge's foot,</l>
<l>It lifted high its arm with all the head,</l>
<l>To bring more closely unto us its words,</l>

<l>Which were: "Behold now the sore penalty,</l>
<l>Thou, who dost breathing go the dead beholding;</l>
<l>Behold if any be as great as this.</l>

<l>And so that thou may carry news of me,</l>
<l>Know that Bertram de Born am I, the same</l>
<l>Who gave to the Young King the evil comfort.</l>

<l>I made the father and the son rebellious;</l>
<l>Achitophel not more with Absalom</l>
<l>And David did with his accursed goadings.</l>

<l>Because I parted persons so united,</l>
<l>Parted do I now bear my brain, alas!</l>
<l>From its beginning, which is in this trunk.</l>

<l>Thus is observed in me the counterpoise."</l>

</canto>
<canto number="XXIX">

<l>The many people and the divers wounds</l>
<l>These eyes of mine had so inebriated,</l>
<l>That they were wishful to stand still and weep;</l>

<l>But said Virgilius: "What dost thou still gaze at?</l>
<l>Why is thy sight still riveted down there</l>
<l>Among the mournful, mutilated shades?</l>

<l>Thou hast not done so at the other Bolge;</l>
<l>Consider, if to count them thou believest,</l>
<l>That two-and-twenty miles the valley winds,</l>

<l>And now the moon is underneath our feet;</l>
<l>Henceforth the time allotted us is brief,</l>
<l>And more is to be seen than what thou seest."</l>

<l>"If thou hadst," I made answer thereupon,</l>
<l>"Attended to the cause for which I looked,</l>
<l>Perhaps a longer stay thou wouldst have pardoned."</l>

<l>Meanwhile my Guide departed, and behind him</l>
<l>I went, already making my reply,</l>
<l>And superadding: "In that cavern where</l>

<l>I held mine eyes with such attention fixed,</l>
<l>I think a spirit of my blood laments</l>
<l>The sin which down below there costs so much."</l>

<l>Then said the Master: "Be no longer broken</l>
<l>Thy thought from this time forward upon him;</l>
<l>Attend elsewhere, and there let him remain;</l>

<l>For him I saw below the little bridge,</l>
<l>Pointing at thee, and threatening with his finger</l>
<l>Fiercely, and heard him called Geri del Bello.</l>

<l>So wholly at that time wast thou impeded</l>
<l>By him who formerly held Altaforte,</l>
<l>Thou didst not look that way; so he departed."</l>

<l>"O my Conductor, his own violent death,</l>
<l>Which is not yet avenged for him," I said,</l>
<l>"By any who is sharer in the shame,</l>

<l>Made him disdainful; whence he went away,</l>
<l>As I imagine, without speaking to me,</l>
<l>And thereby made me pity him the more."</l>

<l>Thus did we speak as far as the first place</l>
<l>Upon the crag, which the next valley shows</l>
<l>Down to the bottom, if there were more light.</l>

<l>When we were now right over the last cloister</l>
<l>Of Malebolge, so that its lay-brothers</l>
<l>Could manifest themselves unto our sight,</l>

<l>Divers lamentings pierced me through and through,</l>
<l>Which with compassion had their arrows barbed,</l>
<l>Whereat mine ears I covered with my hands.</l>

<l>What pain would be, if from the hospitals</l>
<l>Of Valdichiana, 'twixt July and September,</l>
<l>And of Maremma and Sardinia</l>

<l>All the diseases in one moat were gathered,</l>
<l>Such was it here, and such a stench came from it</l>
<l>As from putrescent limbs is wont to issue.</l>

<l>We had descended on the furthest bank</l>
<l>From the long crag, upon the left hand still,</l>
<l>And then more vivid was my power of sight</l>

<l>Down tow'rds the bottom, where the ministress</l>
<l>Of the high Lord, Justice infallible,</l>
<l>Punishes forgers, which she here records.</l>

<l>I do not think a sadder sight to see</l>
<l>Was in Aegina the whole people sick,</l>
<l>(When was the air so full of pestilence,</l>

<l>The animals, down to the little worm,</l>
<l>All fell, and afterwards the ancient people,</l>
<l>According as the poets have affirmed,</l>

<l>Were from the seed of ants restored again,)</l>
<l>Than was it to behold through that dark valley</l>
<l>The spirits languishing in divers heaps.</l>

<l>This on the belly, that upon the back</l>
<l>One of the other lay, and others crawling</l>
<l>Shifted themselves along the dismal road.</l>

<l>We step by step went onward without speech,</l>
<l>Gazing upon and listening to the sick</l>
<l>Who had not strength enough to lift their bodies.</l>

<l>I saw two sitting leaned against each other,</l>
<l>As leans in heating platter against platter,</l>
<l>From head to foot bespotted o'er with scabs;</l>

<l>And never saw I plied a currycomb</l>
<l>By stable-boy for whom his master waits,</l>
<l>Or him who keeps awake unwillingly,</l>

<l>As every one was plying fast the bite</l>
<l>Of nails upon himself, for the great rage</l>
<l>Of itching which no other succour had.</l>

<l>And the nails downward with them dragged the scab,</l>
<l>In fashion as a knife the scales of bream,</l>
<l>Or any other fish that has them largest.</l>

<l>"O thou, that with thy fingers dost dismail thee,"</l>
<l>Began my Leader unto one of them,</l>
<l>"And makest of them pincers now and then,</l>

<l>Tell me if any Latian is with those</l>
<l>Who are herein; so may thy nails suffice thee</l>
<l>To all eternity unto this work."</l>

<l>"Latians are we, whom thou so wasted seest,</l>
<l>Both of us here," one weeping made reply;</l>
<l>"But who art thou, that questionest about us?"</l>

<l>And said the Guide: "One am I who descends</l>
<l>Down with this living man from cliff to cliff,</l>
<l>And I intend to show Hell unto him."</l>

<l>Then broken was their mutual support,</l>
<l>And trembling each one turned himself to me,</l>
<l>With others who had heard him by rebound.</l>

<l>Wholly to me did the good Master gather,</l>
<l>Saying: "Say unto them whate'er thou wishest."</l>
<l>And I began, since he would have it so:</l>

<l>"So may your memory not steal away</l>
<l>In the first world from out the minds of men,</l>
<l>But so may it survive 'neath many suns,</l>

<l>Say to me who ye are, and of what people;</l>
<l>Let not your foul and loathsome punishment</l>
<l>Make you afraid to show yourselves to me."</l>

<l>"I of Arezzo was," one made reply,</l>
<l>"And Albert of Siena had me burned;</l>
<l>But what I died for does not bring me here.</l>

<l>'Tis true I said to him, speaking in jest,</l>
<l>That I could rise by flight into the air,</l>
<l>And he who had conceit, but little wit,</l>

<l>Would have me show to him the art; and only</l>
<l>Because no Daedalus I made him, made me</l>
<l>Be burned by one who held him as his son.</l>

<l>But unto the last Bolgia of the ten,</l>
<l>For alchemy, which in the world I practised,</l>
<l>Minos, who cannot err, has me condemned."</l>

<l>And to the Poet said I: "Now was ever</l>
<l>So vain a people as the Sienese?</l>
<l>Not for a certainty the French by far."</l>

<l>Whereat the other leper, who had heard me,</l>
<l>Replied unto my speech: "Taking out Stricca,</l>
<l>Who knew the art of moderate expenses,</l>

<l>And Niccolo, who the luxurious use</l>
<l>Of cloves discovered earliest of all</l>
<l>Within that garden where such seed takes root;</l>

<l>And taking out the band, among whom squandered</l>
<l>Caccia d'Ascian his vineyards and vast woods,</l>
<l>And where his wit the Abbagliato proffered!</l>

<l>But, that thou know who thus doth second thee</l>
<l>Against the Sienese, make sharp thine eye</l>
<l>Tow'rds me, so that my face well answer thee,</l>

<l>And thou shalt see I am Capocchio's shade,</l>
<l>Who metals falsified by alchemy;</l>
<l>Thou must remember, if I well descry thee,</l>

<l>How I a skilful ape of nature was."</l>

</canto>
<canto number="XXX">

<l>'Twas at the time when Juno was enraged,</l>
<l>For Semele, against the Theban blood,</l>
<l>As she already more than once had shown,</l>

<l>So reft of reason Athamas became,</l>
<l>That, seeing his own wife with children twain</l>
<l>Walking encumbered upon either hand,</l>

<l>He cried: "Spread out the nets, that I may take</l>
<l>The lioness and her whelps upon the passage;"</l>
<l>And then extended his unpitying claws,</l>

<l>Seizing the first, who had the name Learchus,</l>
<l>And whirled him round, and dashed him on a rock;</l>
<l>And she, with the other burthen, drowned herself;--</l>

<l>And at the time when fortune downward hurled</l>
<l>The Trojan's arrogance, that all things dared,</l>
<l>So that the king was with his kingdom crushed,</l>

<l>Hecuba sad, disconsolate, and captive,</l>
<l>When lifeless she beheld Polyxena,</l>
<l>And of her Polydorus on the shore</l>

<l>Of ocean was the dolorous one aware,</l>
<l>Out of her senses like a dog she barked,</l>
<l>So much the anguish had her mind distorted;</l>

<l>But not of Thebes the furies nor the Trojan</l>
<l>Were ever seen in any one so cruel</l>
<l>In goading beasts, and much more human members,</l>

<l>As I beheld two shadows pale and naked,</l>
<l>Who, biting, in the manner ran along</l>
<l>That a boar does, when from the sty turned loose.</l>

<l>One to Capocchio came, and by the nape</l>
<l>Seized with its teeth his neck, so that in dragging</l>
<l>It made his belly grate the solid bottom.</l>

<l>And the Aretine, who trembling had remained,</l>
<l>Said to me: "That mad sprite is Gianni Schicchi,</l>
<l>And raving goes thus harrying other people."</l>

<l>"O," said I to him, "so may not the other</l>
<l>Set teeth on thee, let it not weary thee</l>
<l>To tell us who it is, ere it dart hence."</l>

<l>And he to me: "That is the ancient ghost</l>
<l>Of the nefarious Myrrha, who became</l>
<l>Beyond all rightful love her father's lover.</l>

<l>She came to sin with him after this manner,</l>
<l>By counterfeiting of another's form;</l>
<l>As he who goeth yonder undertook,</l>

<l>That he might gain the lady of the herd,</l>
<l>To counterfeit in himself Buoso Donati,</l>
<l>Making a will and giving it due form."</l>

<l>And after the two maniacs had passed</l>
<l>On whom I held mine eye, I turned it back</l>
<l>To look upon the other evil-born.</l>

<l>I saw one made in fashion of a lute,</l>
<l>If he had only had the groin cut off</l>
<l>Just at the point at which a man is forked.</l>

<l>The heavy dropsy, that so disproportions</l>
<l>The limbs with humours, which it ill concocts,</l>
<l>That the face corresponds not to the belly,</l>

<l>Compelled him so to hold his lips apart</l>
<l>As does the hectic, who because of thirst</l>
<l>One tow'rds the chin, the other upward turns.</l>

<l>"O ye, who without any torment are,</l>
<l>And why I know not, in the world of woe,"</l>
<l>He said to us, "behold, and be attentive</l>

<l>Unto the misery of Master Adam;</l>
<l>I had while living much of what I wished,</l>
<l>And now, alas! a drop of water crave.</l>

<l>The rivulets, that from the verdant hills</l>
<l>Of Cassentin descend down into Arno,</l>
<l>Making their channels to be cold and moist,</l>

<l>Ever before me stand, and not in vain;</l>
<l>For far more doth their image dry me up</l>
<l>Than the disease which strips my face of flesh.</l>

<l>The rigid justice that chastises me</l>
<l>Draweth occasion from the place in which</l>
<l>I sinned, to put the more my sighs in flight.</l>

<l>There is Romena, where I counterfeited</l>
<l>The currency imprinted with the Baptist,</l>
<l>For which I left my body burned above.</l>

<l>But if I here could see the tristful soul</l>
<l>Of Guido, or Alessandro, or their brother,</l>
<l>For Branda's fount I would not give the sight.</l>

<l>One is within already, if the raving</l>
<l>Shades that are going round about speak truth;</l>
<l>But what avails it me, whose limbs are tied?</l>

<l>If I were only still so light, that in</l>
<l>A hundred years I could advance one inch,</l>
<l>I had already started on the way,</l>

<l>Seeking him out among this squalid folk,</l>
<l>Although the circuit be eleven miles,</l>
<l>And be not less than half a mile across.</l>

<l>For them am I in such a family;</l>
<l>They did induce me into coining florins,</l>
<l>Which had three carats of impurity."</l>

<l>And I to him: "Who are the two poor wretches</l>
<l>That smoke like unto a wet hand in winter,</l>
<l>Lying there close upon thy right-hand confines?"</l>

<l>"I found them here," replied he, "when I rained</l>
<l>Into this chasm, and since they have not turned,</l>
<l>Nor do I think they will for evermore.</l>

<l>One the false woman is who accused Joseph,</l>
<l>The other the false Sinon, Greek of Troy;</l>
<l>From acute fever they send forth such reek."</l>

<l>And one of them, who felt himself annoyed</l>
<l>At being, peradventure, named so darkly,</l>
<l>Smote with the fist upon his hardened paunch.</l>

<l>It gave a sound, as if it were a drum;</l>
<l>And Master Adam smote him in the face,</l>
<l>With arm that did not seem to be less hard,</l>

<l>Saying to him: "Although be taken from me</l>
<l>All motion, for my limbs that heavy are,</l>
<l>I have an arm unfettered for such need."</l>

<l>Whereat he answer made: "When thou didst go</l>
<l>Unto the fire, thou hadst it not so ready:</l>
<l>But hadst it so and more when thou wast coining."</l>

<l>The dropsical: "Thou sayest true in that;</l>
<l>But thou wast not so true a witness there,</l>
<l>Where thou wast questioned of the truth at Troy."</l>

<l>"If I spake false, thou falsifiedst the coin,"</l>
<l>Said Sinon; "and for one fault I am here,</l>
<l>And thou for more than any other demon."</l>

<l>"Remember, perjurer, about the horse,"</l>
<l>He made reply who had the swollen belly,</l>
<l>"And rueful be it thee the whole world knows it."</l>

<l>"Rueful to thee the thirst be wherewith cracks</l>
<l>Thy tongue," the Greek said, "and the putrid water</l>
<l>That hedges so thy paunch before thine eyes."</l>

<l>Then the false-coiner: "So is gaping wide</l>
<l>Thy mouth for speaking evil, as 'tis wont;</l>
<l>Because if I have thirst, and humour stuff me</l>

<l>Thou hast the burning and the head that aches,</l>
<l>And to lick up the mirror of Narcissus</l>
<l>Thou wouldst not want words many to invite thee."</l>

<l>In listening to them was I wholly fixed,</l>
<l>When said the Master to me: "Now just look,</l>
<l>For little wants it that I quarrel with thee."</l>

<l>When him I heard in anger speak to me,</l>
<l>I turned me round towards him with such shame</l>
<l>That still it eddies through my memory.</l>

<l>And as he is who dreams of his own harm,</l>
<l>Who dreaming wishes it may be a dream,</l>
<l>So that he craves what is, as if it were not;</l>

<l>Such I became, not having power to speak,</l>
<l>For to excuse myself I wished, and still</l>
<l>Excused myself, and did not think I did it.</l>

<l>"Less shame doth wash away a greater fault,"</l>
<l>The Master said, "than this of thine has been;</l>
<l>Therefore thyself disburden of all sadness,</l>

<l>And make account that I am aye beside thee,</l>
<l>If e'er it come to pass that fortune bring thee</l>
<l>Where there are people in a like dispute;</l>

<l>For a base wish it is to wish to hear it."</l>

</canto>
<canto number="XXXI">

<l>One and the selfsame tongue first wounded me,</l>
<l>So that it tinged the one cheek and the other,</l>
<l>And then held out to me the medicine;</l>

<l>Thus do I hear that once Achilles' spear,</l>
<l>His and his father's, used to be the cause</l>
<l>First of a sad and then a gracious boon.</l>

<l>We turned our backs upon the wretched valley,</l>
<l>Upon the bank that girds it round about,</l>
<l>Going across it without any speech.</l>

<l>There it was less than night, and less than day,</l>
<l>So that my sight went little in advance;</l>
<l>But I could hear the blare of a loud horn,</l>

<l>So loud it would have made each thunder faint,</l>
<l>Which, counter to it following its way,</l>
<l>Mine eyes directed wholly to one place.</l>

<l>After the dolorous discomfiture</l>
<l>When Charlemagne the holy emprise lost,</l>
<l>So terribly Orlando sounded not.</l>

<l>Short while my head turned thitherward I held</l>
<l>When many lofty towers I seemed to see,</l>
<l>Whereat I: "Master, say, what town is this?"</l>

<l>And he to me: "Because thou peerest forth</l>
<l>Athwart the darkness at too great a distance,</l>
<l>It happens that thou errest in thy fancy.</l>

<l>Well shalt thou see, if thou arrivest there,</l>
<l>How much the sense deceives itself by distance;</l>
<l>Therefore a little faster spur thee on."</l>

<l>Then tenderly he took me by the hand,</l>
<l>And said: "Before we farther have advanced,</l>
<l>That the reality may seem to thee</l>

<l>Less strange, know that these are not towers, but giants,</l>
<l>And they are in the well, around the bank,</l>
<l>From navel downward, one and all of them."</l>

<l>As, when the fog is vanishing away,</l>
<l>Little by little doth the sight refigure</l>
<l>Whate'er the mist that crowds the air conceals,</l>

<l>So, piercing through the dense and darksome air,</l>
<l>More and more near approaching tow'rd the verge,</l>
<l>My error fled, and fear came over me;</l>

<l>Because as on its circular parapets</l>
<l>Montereggione crowns itself with towers,</l>
<l>E'en thus the margin which surrounds the well</l>

<l>With one half of their bodies turreted</l>
<l>The horrible giants, whom Jove menaces</l>
<l>E'en now from out the heavens when he thunders.</l>

<l>And I of one already saw the face,</l>
<l>Shoulders, and breast, and great part of the belly,</l>
<l>And down along his sides both of the arms.</l>

<l>Certainly Nature, when she left the making</l>
<l>Of animals like these, did well indeed,</l>
<l>By taking such executors from Mars;</l>

<l>And if of elephants and whales she doth not</l>
<l>Repent her, whosoever looketh subtly</l>
<l>More just and more discreet will hold her for it;</l>

<l>For where the argument of intellect</l>
<l>Is added unto evil will and power,</l>
<l>No rampart can the people make against it.</l>

<l>His face appeared to me as long and large</l>
<l>As is at Rome the pine-cone of Saint Peter's,</l>
<l>And in proportion were the other bones;</l>

<l>So that the margin, which an apron was</l>
<l>Down from the middle, showed so much of him</l>
<l>Above it, that to reach up to his hair</l>

<l>Three Frieslanders in vain had vaunted them;</l>
<l>For I beheld thirty great palms of him</l>
<l>Down from the place where man his mantle buckles.</l>

<l>"Raphael mai amech izabi almi,"</l>
<l>Began to clamour the ferocious mouth,</l>
<l>To which were not befitting sweeter psalms.</l>

<l>And unto him my Guide: "Soul idiotic,</l>
<l>Keep to thy horn, and vent thyself with that,</l>
<l>When wrath or other passion touches thee.</l>

<l>Search round thy neck, and thou wilt find the belt</l>
<l>Which keeps it fastened, O bewildered soul,</l>
<l>And see it, where it bars thy mighty breast."</l>

<l>Then said to me: "He doth himself accuse;</l>
<l>This one is Nimrod, by whose evil thought</l>
<l>One language in the world is not still used.</l>

<l>Here let us leave him and not speak in vain;</l>
<l>For even such to him is every language</l>
<l>As his to others, which to none is known."</l>

<l>Therefore a longer journey did we make,</l>
<l>Turned to the left, and a crossbow-shot oft</l>
<l>We found another far more fierce and large.</l>

<l>In binding him, who might the master be</l>
<l>I cannot say; but he had pinioned close</l>
<l>Behind the right arm, and in front the other,</l>

<l>With chains, that held him so begirt about</l>
<l>From the neck down, that on the part uncovered</l>
<l>It wound itself as far as the fifth gyre.</l>

<l>"This proud one wished to make experiment</l>
<l>Of his own power against the Supreme Jove,"</l>
<l>My Leader said, "whence he has such a guerdon.</l>

<l>Ephialtes is his name; he showed great prowess.</l>
<l>What time the giants terrified the gods;</l>
<l>The arms he wielded never more he moves."</l>

<l>And I to him: "If possible, I should wish</l>
<l>That of the measureless Briareus</l>
<l>These eyes of mine might have experience."</l>

<l>Whence he replied: "Thou shalt behold Antaeus</l>
<l>Close by here, who can speak and is unbound,</l>
<l>Who at the bottom of all crime shall place us.</l>

<l>Much farther yon is he whom thou wouldst see,</l>
<l>And he is bound, and fashioned like to this one,</l>
<l>Save that he seems in aspect more ferocious."</l>

<l>There never was an earthquake of such might</l>
<l>That it could shake a tower so violently,</l>
<l>As Ephialtes suddenly shook himself.</l>

<l>Then was I more afraid of death than ever,</l>
<l>For nothing more was needful than the fear,</l>
<l>If I had not beheld the manacles.</l>

<l>Then we proceeded farther in advance,</l>
<l>And to Antaeus came, who, full five ells</l>
<l>Without the head, forth issued from the cavern.</l>

<l>"O thou, who in the valley fortunate,</l>
<l>Which Scipio the heir of glory made,</l>
<l>When Hannibal turned back with all his hosts,</l>

<l>Once brought'st a thousand lions for thy prey,</l>
<l>And who, hadst thou been at the mighty war</l>
<l>Among thy brothers, some it seems still think</l>

<l>The sons of Earth the victory would have gained:</l>
<l>Place us below, nor be disdainful of it,</l>
<l>There where the cold doth lock Cocytus up.</l>

<l>Make us not go to Tityus nor Typhoeus;</l>
<l>This one can give of that which here is longed for;</l>
<l>Therefore stoop down, and do not curl thy lip.</l>

<l>Still in the world can he restore thy fame;</l>
<l>Because he lives, and still expects long life,</l>
<l>If to itself Grace call him not untimely."</l>

<l>So said the Master; and in haste the other</l>
<l>His hands extended and took up my Guide,--</l>
<l>Hands whose great pressure Hercules once felt.</l>

<l>Virgilius, when he felt himself embraced,</l>
<l>Said unto me: "Draw nigh, that I may take thee;"</l>
<l>Then of himself and me one bundle made.</l>

<l>As seems the Carisenda, to behold</l>
<l>Beneath the leaning side, when goes a cloud</l>
<l>Above it so that opposite it hangs;</l>

<l>Such did Antaeus seem to me, who stood</l>
<l>Watching to see him stoop, and then it was</l>
<l>I could have wished to go some other way.</l>

<l>But lightly in the abyss, which swallows up</l>
<l>Judas with Lucifer, he put us down;</l>
<l>Nor thus bowed downward made he there delay,</l>

<l>But, as a mast does in a ship, uprose.</l>

<canto number="XXXII">

<l>If I had rhymes both rough and stridulous,</l>
<l>As were appropriate to the dismal hole</l>
<l>Down upon which thrust all the other rocks,</l>

<l>I would press out the juice of my conception</l>
<l>More fully; but because I have them not,</l>
<l>Not without fear I bring myself to speak;</l>

<l>For 'tis no enterprise to take in jest,</l>
<l>To sketch the bottom of all the universe,</l>
<l>Nor for a tongue that cries Mamma and Babbo.</l>

<l>But may those Ladies help this verse of mine,</l>
<l>Who helped Amphion in enclosing Thebes,</l>
<l>That from the fact the word be not diverse.</l>

<l>O rabble ill-begotten above all,</l>
<l>Who're in the place to speak of which is hard,</l>
<l>'Twere better ye had here been sheep or goats!</l>

<l>When we were down within the darksome well,</l>
<l>Beneath the giant's feet, but lower far,</l>
<l>And I was scanning still the lofty wall,</l>

<l>I heard it said to me: "Look how thou steppest!</l>
<l>Take heed thou do not trample with thy feet</l>
<l>The heads of the tired, miserable brothers!"</l>

<l>Whereat I turned me round, and saw before me</l>
<l>And underfoot a lake, that from the frost</l>
<l>The semblance had of glass, and not of water.</l>

<l>So thick a veil ne'er made upon its current</l>
<l>In winter-time Danube in Austria,</l>
<l>Nor there beneath the frigid sky the Don,</l>

<l>As there was here; so that if Tambernich</l>
<l>Had fallen upon it, or Pietrapana,</l>
<l>E'en at the edge 'twould not have given a creak.</l>

<l>And as to croak the frog doth place himself</l>
<l>With muzzle out of water,--when is dreaming</l>
<l>Of gleaning oftentimes the peasant-girl,--</l>

<l>Livid, as far down as where shame appears,</l>
<l>Were the disconsolate shades within the ice,</l>
<l>Setting their teeth unto the note of storks.</l>

<l>Each one his countenance held downward bent;</l>
<l>From mouth the cold, from eyes the doleful heart</l>
<l>Among them witness of itself procures.</l>

<l>When round about me somewhat I had looked,</l>
<l>I downward turned me, and saw two so close,</l>
<l>The hair upon their heads together mingled.</l>

<l>"Ye who so strain your breasts together, tell me,"</l>
<l>I said, "who are you;" and they bent their necks,</l>
<l>And when to me their faces they had lifted,</l>

<l>Their eyes, which first were only moist within,</l>
<l>Gushed o'er the eyelids, and the frost congealed</l>
<l>The tears between, and locked them up again.</l>

<l>Clamp never bound together wood with wood</l>
<l>So strongly; whereat they, like two he-goats,</l>
<l>Butted together, so much wrath o'ercame them.</l>

<l>And one, who had by reason of the cold</l>
<l>Lost both his ears, still with his visage downward,</l>
<l>Said: "Why dost thou so mirror thyself in us?</l>

<l>If thou desire to know who these two are,</l>
<l>The valley whence Bisenzio descends</l>
<l>Belonged to them and to their father Albert.</l>

<l>They from one body came, and all Caina</l>
<l>Thou shalt search through, and shalt not find a shade</l>
<l>More worthy to be fixed in gelatine;</l>

<l>Not he in whom were broken breast and shadow</l>
<l>At one and the same blow by Arthur's hand;</l>
<l>Focaccia not; not he who me encumbers</l>

<l>So with his head I see no farther forward,</l>
<l>And bore the name of Sassol Mascheroni;</l>
<l>Well knowest thou who he was, if thou art Tuscan.</l>

<l>And that thou put me not to further speech,</l>
<l>Know that I Camicion de' Pazzi was,</l>
<l>And wait Carlino to exonerate me."</l>

<l>Then I beheld a thousand faces, made</l>
<l>Purple with cold; whence o'er me comes a shudder,</l>
<l>And evermore will come, at frozen ponds.</l>

<l>And while we were advancing tow'rds the middle,</l>
<l>Where everything of weight unites together,</l>
<l>And I was shivering in the eternal shade,</l>

<l>Whether 'twere will, or destiny, or chance,</l>
<l>I know not; but in walking 'mong the heads</l>
<l>I struck my foot hard in the face of one.</l>

<l>Weeping he growled: "Why dost thou trample me?</l>
<l>Unless thou comest to increase the vengeance</l>
<l>of Montaperti, why dost thou molest me?"</l>

<l>And I: "My Master, now wait here for me,</l>
<l>That I through him may issue from a doubt;</l>
<l>Then thou mayst hurry me, as thou shalt wish."</l>

<l>The Leader stopped; and to that one I said</l>
<l>Who was blaspheming vehemently still:</l>
<l>"Who art thou, that thus reprehendest others?"</l>

<l>"Now who art thou, that goest through Antenora</l>
<l>Smiting," replied he, "other people's cheeks,</l>
<l>So that, if thou wert living, 'twere too much?"</l>

<l>"Living I am, and dear to thee it may be,"</l>
<l>Was my response, "if thou demandest fame,</l>
<l>That 'mid the other notes thy name I place."</l>

<l>And he to me: "For the reverse I long;</l>
<l>Take thyself hence, and give me no more trouble;</l>
<l>For ill thou knowest to flatter in this hollow."</l>

<l>Then by the scalp behind I seized upon him,</l>
<l>And said: "It must needs be thou name thyself,</l>
<l>Or not a hair remain upon thee here."</l>

<l>Whence he to me: "Though thou strip off my hair,</l>
<l>I will not tell thee who I am, nor show thee,</l>
<l>If on my head a thousand times thou fall."</l>

<l>I had his hair in hand already twisted,</l>
<l>And more than one shock of it had pulled out,</l>
<l>He barking, with his eyes held firmly down,</l>

<l>When cried another: "What doth ail thee, Bocca?</l>
<l>Is't not enough to clatter with thy jaws,</l>
<l>But thou must bark? what devil touches thee?"</l>

<l>"Now," said I, "I care not to have thee speak,</l>
<l>Accursed traitor; for unto thy shame</l>
<l>I will report of thee veracious news."</l>

<l>"Begone," replied he, "and tell what thou wilt,</l>
<l>But be not silent, if thou issue hence,</l>
<l>Of him who had just now his tongue so prompt;</l>

<l>He weepeth here the silver of the French;</l>
<l>'I saw,' thus canst thou phrase it, 'him of Duera</l>
<l>There where the sinners stand out in the cold.'</l>

<l>If thou shouldst questioned be who else was there,</l>
<l>Thou hast beside thee him of Beccaria,</l>
<l>Of whom the gorget Florence slit asunder;</l>

<l>Gianni del Soldanier, I think, may be</l>
<l>Yonder with Ganellon, and Tebaldello</l>
<l>Who oped Faenza when the people slep."</l>

<l>Already we had gone away from him,</l>
<l>When I beheld two frozen in one hole,</l>
<l>So that one head a hood was to the other;</l>

<l>And even as bread through hunger is devoured,</l>
<l>The uppermost on the other set his teeth,</l>
<l>There where the brain is to the nape united.</l>

<l>Not in another fashion Tydeus gnawed</l>
<l>The temples of Menalippus in disdain,</l>
<l>Than that one did the skull and the other things.</l>

<l>"O thou, who showest by such bestial sign</l>
<l>Thy hatred against him whom thou art eating,</l>
<l>Tell me the wherefore," said I, "with this compact,</l>

<l>That if thou rightfully of him complain,</l>
<l>In knowing who ye are, and his transgression,</l>
<l>I in the world above repay thee for it,</l>

<l>If that wherewith I speak be not dried up."</l>

</canto>
<canto number="XXXIII">

<l>His mouth uplifted from his grim repast,</l>
<l>That sinner, wiping it upon the hair</l>
<l>Of the same head that he behind had wasted.</l>

<l>Then he began: "Thou wilt that I renew</l>
<l>The desperate grief, which wrings my heart already</l>
<l>To think of only, ere I speak of it;</l>

<l>But if my words be seed that may bear fruit</l>
<l>Of infamy to the traitor whom I gnaw,</l>
<l>Speaking and weeping shalt thou see together.</l>

<l>I know not who thou art, nor by what mode</l>
<l>Thou hast come down here; but a Florentine</l>
<l>Thou seemest to me truly, when I hear thee.</l>

<l>Thou hast to know I was Count Ugolino,</l>
<l>And this one was Ruggieri the Archbishop;</l>
<l>Now I will tell thee why I am such a neighbour.</l>

<l>That, by effect of his malicious thoughts,</l>
<l>Trusting in him I was made prisoner,</l>
<l>And after put to death, I need not say;</l>

<l> But ne'ertheless what thou canst not have heard,</l>
<l>That is to say, how cruel was my death,</l>
<l>Hear shalt thou, and shalt know if he has wronged me.</l>

<l>A narrow perforation in the mew,</l>
<l>Which bears because of me the title of Famine,</l>
<l>And in which others still must be locked up,</l>

<l>Had shown me through its opening many moons</l>
<l>Already, when I dreamed the evil dream</l>
<l>Which of the future rent for me the veil.</l>

<l>This one appeared to me as lord and master,</l>
<l>Hunting the wolf and whelps upon the mountain</l>
<l>For which the Pisans cannot Lucca see.</l>

<l>With sleuth-hounds gaunt, and eager, and well trained,</l>
<l>Gualandi with Sismondi and Lanfianchi</l>
<l>He had sent out before him to the front.</l>

<l>After brief course seemed unto me forespent</l>
<l>The father and the sons, and with sharp tushes</l>
<l>It seemed to me I saw their flanks ripped open.</l>

<l>When I before the morrow was awake,</l>
<l>Moaning amid their sleep I heard my sons</l>
<l>Who with me were, and asking after bread.</l>

<l>Cruel indeed art thou, if yet thou grieve not,</l>
<l>Thinking of what my heart foreboded me,</l>
<l>And weep'st thou not, what art thou wont to weep at?</l>

<l>They were awake now, and the hour drew nigh</l>
<l>At which our food used to be brought to us,</l>
<l>And through his dream was each one apprehensive;</l>

<l>And I heard locking up the under door</l>
<l>Of the horrible tower; whereat without a word</l>
<l>I gazed into the faces of my sons.</l>

<l>I wept not, I within so turned to stone;</l>
<l>They wept; and darling little Anselm mine</l>
<l>Said: 'Thou dost gaze so, father, what doth ail thee?'</l>

<l>Still not a tear I shed, nor answer made</l>
<l>All of that day, nor yet the night thereafter,</l>
<l>Until another sun rose on the world.</l>

<l>As now a little glimmer made its way</l>
<l>Into the dolorous prison, and I saw</l>
<l>Upon four faces my own very aspect,</l>

<l>Both of my hands in agony I bit;</l>
<l>And, thinking that I did it from desire</l>
<l>Of eating, on a sudden they uprose,</l>

<l>And said they: 'Father, much less pain 'twill give us</l>
<l>If thou do eat of us; thyself didst clothe us</l>
<l>With this poor flesh, and do thou strip it off.'</l>

<l>I calmed me then, not to make them more sad.</l>
<l>That day we all were silent, and the next.</l>
<l>Ah! obdurate earth, wherefore didst thou not open?</l>

<l>When we had come unto the fourth day, Gaddo</l>
<l>Threw himself down outstretched before my feet,</l>
<l>Saying, 'My father, why dost thou not help me?'</l>

<l>And there he died; and, as thou seest me,</l>
<l>I saw the three fall, one by one, between</l>
<l>The fifth day and the sixth; whence I betook me,</l>

<l>Already blind, to groping over each,</l>
<l>And three days called them after they were dead;</l>
<l>Then hunger did what sorrow could not do."</l>

<l>When he had said this, with his eyes distorted,</l>
<l>The wretched skull resumed he with his teeth,</l>
<l>Which, as a dog's, upon the bone were strong.</l>

<l>Ah! Pisa, thou opprobrium of the people</l>
<l>Of the fair land there where the 'Si' doth sound,</l>
<l>Since slow to punish thee thy neighbours are,</l>

<l>Let the Capraia and Gorgona move,</l>
<l>And make a hedge across the mouth of Arno</l>
<l>That every person in thee it may drown!</l>

<l>For if Count Ugolino had the fame</l>
<l>Of having in thy castles thee betrayed,</l>
<l>Thou shouldst not on such cross have put his sons.</l>

<l>Guiltless of any crime, thou modern Thebes!</l>
<l>Their youth made Uguccione and Brigata,</l>
<l>And the other two my song doth name above!</l>

<l>We passed still farther onward, where the ice</l>
<l>Another people ruggedly enswathes,</l>
<l>Not downward turned, but all of them reversed.</l>

<l>Weeping itself there does not let them weep,</l>
<l>And grief that finds a barrier in the eyes</l>
<l>Turns itself inward to increase the anguish;</l>

<l>Because the earliest tears a cluster form,</l>
<l>And, in the manner of a crystal visor,</l>
<l>Fill all the cup beneath the eyebrow full.</l>

<l>And notwithstanding that, as in a callus,</l>
<l>Because of cold all sensibility</l>
<l>Its station had abandoned in my face,</l>

<l>Still it appeared to me I felt some wind;</l>
<l>Whence I: "My Master, who sets this in motion?</l>
<l>Is not below here every vapour quenched?"</l>

<l>Whence he to me: "Full soon shalt thou be where</l>
<l>Thine eye shall answer make to thee of this,</l>
<l>Seeing the cause which raineth down the blast."</l>

<l>And one of the wretches of the frozen crust</l>
<l>Cried out to us: "O souls so merciless</l>
<l>That the last post is given unto you,</l>

<l>Lift from mine eyes the rigid veils, that I</l>
<l>May vent the sorrow which impregns my heart</l>
<l>A little, e'er the weeping recongeal."</l>

<l>Whence I to him: "If thou wouldst have me help thee</l>
<l>Say who thou wast; and if I free thee not,</l>
<l>May I go to the bottom of the ice."</l>

<l>Then he replied: "I am Friar Alberigo;</l>
<l>He am I of the fruit of the bad garden,</l>
<l>Who here a date am getting for my fig."</l>

<l>"O," said I to him, "now art thou, too, dead?"</l>
<l>And he to me: "How may my body fare</l>
<l>Up in the world, no knowledge I possess.</l>

<l>Such an advantage has this Ptolomaea,</l>
<l>That oftentimes the soul descendeth here</l>
<l>Sooner than Atropos in motion sets it.</l>

<l>And, that thou mayest more willingly remove</l>
<l>From off my countenance these glassy tears,</l>
<l>Know that as soon as any soul betrays</l>

<l>As I have done, his body by a demon</l>
<l>Is taken from him, who thereafter rules it,</l>
<l>Until his time has wholly been revolved.</l>

<l>Itself down rushes into such a cistern;</l>
<l>And still perchance above appears the body</l>
<l>Of yonder shade, that winters here behind me.</l>

<l>This thou shouldst know, if thou hast just come down;</l>
<l>It is Ser Branca d' Oria, and many years</l>
<l>Have passed away since he was thus locked up."</l>

<l>"I think," said I to him, "thou dost deceive me;</l>
<l>For Branca d' Oria is not dead as yet,</l>
<l>And eats, and drinks, and sleeps, and puts on clothes."</l>

<l>"In moat above," said he, "of Malebranche,</l>
<l>There where is boiling the tenacious pitch,</l>
<l>As yet had Michel Zanche not arrived,</l>

<l>When this one left a devil in his stead</l>
<l>In his own body and one near of kin,</l>
<l>Who made together with him the betrayal.</l>

<l>But hitherward stretch out thy hand forthwith,</l>
<l>Open mine eyes;"--and open them I did not,</l>
<l>And to be rude to him was courtesy.</l>

<l>Ah, Genoese! ye men at variance</l>
<l>With every virtue, full of every vice</l>
<l>Wherefore are ye not scattered from the world?</l>

<l>For with the vilest spirit of Romagna</l>
<l>I found of you one such, who for his deeds</l>
<l>In soul already in Cocytus bathes,</l>

<l>And still above in body seems alive!</l>

<canto number="XXXIV">

<l>"'Vexilla Regis prodeunt Inferni'</l>
<l>Towards us; therefore look in front of thee,"</l>
<l>My Master said, "if thou discernest him."</l>

<l>As, when there breathes a heavy fog, or when</l>
<l>Our hemisphere is darkening into night,</l>
<l>Appears far off a mill the wind is turning,</l>

<l>Methought that such a building then I saw;</l>
<l>And, for the wind, I drew myself behind</l>
<l>My Guide, because there was no other shelter.</l>

<l>Now was I, and with fear in verse I put it,</l>
<l>There where the shades were wholly covered up,</l>
<l>And glimmered through like unto straws in glass.</l>

<l>Some prone are lying, others stand erect,</l>
<l>This with the head, and that one with the soles;</l>
<l>Another, bow-like, face to feet inverts.</l>

<l>When in advance so far we had proceeded,</l>
<l>That it my Master pleased to show to me</l>
<l>The creature who once had the beauteous semblance,</l>

<l>He from before me moved and made me stop,</l>
<l>Saying: "Behold Dis, and behold the place</l>
<l>Where thou with fortitude must arm thyself."</l>

<l>How frozen I became and powerless then,</l>
<l>Ask it not, Reader, for I write it not,</l>
<l>Because all language would be insufficient.</l>

<l>I did not die, and I alive remained not;</l>
<l>Think for thyself now, hast thou aught of wit,</l>
<l>What I became, being of both deprived.</l>

<l>The Emperor of the kingdom dolorous</l>
<l>From his mid-breast forth issued from the ice;</l>
<l>And better with a giant I compare</l>

<l>Than do the giants with those arms of his;</l>
<l>Consider now how great must be that whole,</l>
<l>Which unto such a part conforms itself.</l>

<l>Were he as fair once, as he now is foul,</l>
<l>And lifted up his brow against his Maker,</l>
<l>Well may proceed from him all tribulation.</l>

<l>O, what a marvel it appeared to me,</l>
<l>When I beheld three faces on his head!</l>
<l>The one in front, and that vermilion was;</l>

<l>Two were the others, that were joined with this</l>
<l>Above the middle part of either shoulder,</l>
<l>And they were joined together at the crest;</l>

<l>And the right-hand one seemed 'twixt white and yellow;</l>
<l>The left was such to look upon as those</l>
<l>Who come from where the Nile falls valley-ward.</l>

<l>Underneath each came forth two mighty wings,</l>
<l>Such as befitting were so great a bird;</l>
<l>Sails of the sea I never saw so large.</l>

<l> No feathers had they, but as of a bat</l>
<l>Their fashion was; and he was waving them,</l>
<l>So that three winds proceeded forth therefrom.</l>

<l>Thereby Cocytus wholly was congealed.</l>
<l>With six eyes did he weep, and down three chins</l>
<l>Trickled the tear-drops and the bloody drivel.</l>

<l>At every mouth he with his teeth was crunching</l>
<l>A sinner, in the manner of a brake,</l>
<l>So that he three of them tormented thus.</l>

<l>To him in front the biting was as naught</l>
<l>Unto the clawing, for sometimes the spine</l>
<l>Utterly stripped of all the skin remained.</l>

<l>"That soul up there which has the greatest pain,"</l>
<l>The Master said, "is Judas Iscariot;</l>
<l>With head inside, he plies his legs without.</l>

<l>Of the two others, who head downward are,</l>
<l>The one who hangs from the black jowl is Brutus;</l>
<l>See how he writhes himself, and speaks no word.</l>

<l>And the other, who so stalwart seems, is Cassius.</l>
<l>But night is reascending, and 'tis time</l>
<l>That we depart, for we have seen the whole."</l>

<l>As seemed him good, I clasped him round the neck,</l>
<l>And he the vantage seized of time and place,</l>
<l>And when the wings were opened wide apart,</l>

<l>He laid fast hold upon the shaggy sides;</l>
<l>From fell to fell descended downward then</l>
<l>Between the thick hair and the frozen crust.</l>

<l>When we were come to where the thigh revolves</l>
<l>Exactly on the thickness of the haunch,</l>
<l>The Guide, with labour and with hard-drawn breath,</l>

<l>Turned round his head where he had had his legs,</l>
<l>And grappled to the hair, as one who mounts,</l>
<l>So that to Hell I thought we were returning.</l>

<l>"Keep fast thy hold, for by such stairs as these,"</l>
<l>The Master said, panting as one fatigued,</l>
<l>"Must we perforce depart from so much evil."</l>

<l>Then through the opening of a rock he issued,</l>
<l>And down upon the margin seated me;</l>
<l>Then tow'rds me he outstretched his wary step.</l>

<l>I lifted up mine eyes and thought to see</l>
<l>Lucifer in the same way I had left him;</l>
<l>And I beheld him upward hold his legs.</l>

<l>And if I then became disquieted,</l>
<l>Let stolid people think who do not see</l>
<l>What the point is beyond which I had passed.</l>

<l>"Rise up," the Master said, "upon thy feet;</l>
<l>The way is long, and difficult the road,</l>
<l>And now the sun to middle-tierce returns."</l>

<l>It was not any palace corridor</l>
<l>There where we were, but dungeon natural,</l>
<l>With floor uneven and unease of light.</l>

<l>"Ere from the abyss I tear myself away,</l>
<l>My Master," said I when I had arisen,</l>
<l>"To draw me from an error speak a little;</l>

<l>Where is the ice? and how is this one fixed</l>
<l>Thus upside down? and how in such short time</l>
<l>From eve to morn has the sun made his transit?"</l>

<l>And he to me: "Thou still imaginest</l>
<l>Thou art beyond the centre, where I grasped</l>
<l>The hair of the fell worm, who mines the world.</l>

<l>That side thou wast, so long as I descended;</l>
<l>When round I turned me, thou didst pass the point</l>
<l>To which things heavy draw from every side,</l>

<l>And now beneath the hemisphere art come</l>
<l>Opposite that which overhangs the vast</l>
<l>Dry-land, and 'neath whose cope was put to death</l>

<l>The Man who without sin was born and lived.</l>
<l>Thou hast thy feet upon the little sphere</l>
<l>Which makes the other face of the Judecca.</l>

<l>Here it is morn when it is evening there;</l>
<l>And he who with his hair a stairway made us</l>
<l>Still fixed remaineth as he was before.</l>

<l>Upon this side he fell down out of heaven;</l>
<l>And all the land, that whilom here emerged,</l>
<l>For fear of him made of the sea a veil,</l>

<l>And came to our hemisphere; and peradventure</l>
<l>To flee from him, what on this side appears</l>
<l>Left the place vacant here, and back recoiled."</l>

<l>A place there is below, from Beelzebub</l>
<l>As far receding as the tomb extends,</l>
<l>Which not by sight is known, but by the sound</l>

<l>Of a small rivulet, that there descendeth</l>
<l>Through chasm within the stone, which it has gnawed</l>
<l>With course that winds about and slightly falls.</l>

<l>The Guide and I into that hidden road</l>
<l>Now entered, to return to the bright world;</l>
<l>And without care of having any rest</l>

<l>We mounted up, he first and I the second,</l>
<l>Till I beheld through a round aperture</l>
<l>Some of the beauteous things that Heaven doth bear;</l>

<l>Thence we came forth to rebehold the stars.</l>
