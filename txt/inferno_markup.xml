<canto numeral="I"/>

<stanza>
<lb/>Midway upon the journey of our life
<lb/>I found myself within a forest dark,
<lb/>For the straightforward pathway had been lost.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say
<lb/>What was this forest savage, rough, and stern,
<lb/>Which in the very thought renews the fear.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>So bitter is it, death is little more;
<lb/>But of the good to treat, which there I found,
<lb/>Speak will I of the other things I saw there.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I cannot well repeat how there I entered,
<lb/>So full was I of slumber at the moment
<lb/>In which I had abandoned the true way.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But after I had reached a mountain's foot,
<lb/>At that point where the valley terminated,
<lb/>Which had with consternation pierced my heart,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Upward I looked, and I beheld its shoulders,
<lb/>Vested already with that planet's rays
<lb/>Which leadeth others right by every road.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then was the fear a little quieted
<lb/>That in my heart's lake had endured throughout
<lb/>The night, which I had passed so piteously.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And even as he, who, with distressful breath,
<lb/>Forth issued from the sea upon the shore,
<lb/>Turns to the water perilous and gazes;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>So did my soul, that still was fleeing onward,
<lb/>Turn itself back to re-behold the pass
<lb/>Which never yet a living person left.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>After my weary body I had rested,
<lb/>The way resumed I on the desert slope,
<lb/>So that the firm foot ever was the lower.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And lo! almost where the ascent began,
<lb/>A panther light and swift exceedingly,
<lb/>Which with a spotted skin was covered o'er!
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And never moved she from before my face,
<lb/>Nay, rather did impede so much my way,
<lb/>That many times I to return had turned.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The time was the beginning of the morning,
<lb/>And up the sun was mounting with those stars
<lb/>That with him were, what time the Love Divine
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>At first in motion set those beauteous things;
<lb/>So were to me occasion of good hope,
<lb/>The variegated skin of that wild beast,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The hour of time, and the delicious season;
<lb/>But not so much, that did not give me fear
<lb/>A lion's aspect which appeared to me.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>He seemed as if against me he were coming
<lb/>With head uplifted, and with ravenous hunger,
<lb/>So that it seemed the air was afraid of him;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And a she-wolf, that with all hungerings
<lb/>Seemed to be laden in her meagreness,
<lb/>And many folk has caused to live forlorn!
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>She brought upon me so much heaviness,
<lb/>With the affright that from her aspect came,
<lb/>That I the hope relinquished of the height.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And as he is who willingly acquires,
<lb/>And the time comes that causes him to lose,
<lb/>Who weeps in all his thoughts and is despondent,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>E'en such made me that beast withouten peace,
<lb/>Which, coming on against me by degrees
<lb/>Thrust me back thither where the sun is silent.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>While I was rushing downward to the lowland,
<lb/>Before mine eyes did one present himself,
<lb/>Who seemed from long-continued silence hoarse.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>When I beheld him in the desert vast,
<lb/>"Have pity on me," unto him I cried,
<lb/>"Whiche'er thou art, or shade or real man!"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>He answered me: "Not man; man once I was,
<lb/>And both my parents were of Lombardy,
<lb/>And Mantuans by country both of them.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>'Sub Julio' was I born, though it was late,
<lb/>And lived at Rome under the good Augustus,
<lb/>During the time of false and lying gods.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>A poet was I, and I sang that just
<lb/>Son of Anchises, who came forth from Troy,
<lb/>After that Ilion the superb was burned.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But thou, why goest thou back to such annoyance?
<lb/>Why climb'st thou not the Mount Delectable,
<lb/>Which is the source and cause of every joy?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Now, art thou that Virgilius and that fountain
<lb/>Which spreads abroad so wide a river of speech?"
<lb/>I made response to him with bashful forehead.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"O, of the other poets honour and light,
<lb/>Avail me the long study and great love
<lb/>That have impelled me to explore thy volume!
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thou art my master, and my author thou,
<lb/>Thou art alone the one from whom I took
<lb/>The beautiful style that has done honour to me.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Behold the beast, for which I have turned back;
<lb/>Do thou protect me from her, famous Sage,
<lb/>For she doth make my veins and pulses tremble."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Thee it behoves to take another road,"
<lb/>Responded he, when he beheld me weeping,
<lb/>"If from this savage place thou wouldst escape;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Because this beast, at which thou criest out,
<lb/>Suffers not any one to pass her way,
<lb/>But so doth harass him, that she destroys him;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And has a nature so malign and ruthless,
<lb/>That never doth she glut her greedy will,
<lb/>And after food is hungrier than before.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Many the animals with whom she weds,
<lb/>And more they shall be still, until the Greyhound
<lb/>Comes, who shall make her perish in her pain.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>He shall not feed on either earth or pelf,
<lb/>But upon wisdom, and on love and virtue;
<lb/>'Twixt Feltro and Feltro shall his nation be;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Of that low Italy shall he be the saviour,
<lb/>On whose account the maid Camilla died,
<lb/>Euryalus, Turnus, Nisus, of their wounds;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Through every city shall he hunt her down,
<lb/>Until he shall have driven her back to Hell,
<lb/>There from whence envy first did let her loose.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Therefore I think and judge it for thy best
<lb/>Thou follow me, and I will be thy guide,
<lb/>And lead thee hence through the eternal place,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Where thou shalt hear the desperate lamentations,
<lb/>Shalt see the ancient spirits disconsolate,
<lb/>Who cry out each one for the second death;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And thou shalt see those who contented are
<lb/>Within the fire, because they hope to come,
<lb/>Whene'er it may be, to the blessed people;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>To whom, then, if thou wishest to ascend,
<lb/>A soul shall be for that than I more worthy;
<lb/>With her at my departure I will leave thee;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Because that Emperor, who reigns above,
<lb/>In that I was rebellious to his law,
<lb/>Wills that through me none come into his city.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>He governs everywhere, and there he reigns;
<lb/>There is his city and his lofty throne;
<lb/>O happy he whom thereto he elects!"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And I to him: "Poet, I thee entreat,
<lb/>By that same God whom thou didst never know,
<lb/>So that I may escape this woe and worse,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thou wouldst conduct me there where thou hast said,
<lb/>That I may see the portal of Saint Peter,
<lb/>And those thou makest so disconsolate."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then he moved on, and I behind him followed.
</stanza>

<canto numeral="II"/>

<stanza>
<lb/>Day was departing, and the embrowned air
<lb/>Released the animals that are on earth
<lb/>From their fatigues; and I the only one
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Made myself ready to sustain the war,
<lb/>Both of the way and likewise of the woe,
<lb/>Which memory that errs not shall retrace.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>O Muses, O high genius, now assist me!
<lb/>O memory, that didst write down what I saw,
<lb/>Here thy nobility shall be manifest!
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And I began: "Poet, who guidest me,
<lb/>Regard my manhood, if it be sufficient,
<lb/>Ere to the arduous pass thou dost confide me.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thou sayest, that of Silvius the parent,
<lb/>While yet corruptible, unto the world
<lb/>Immortal went, and was there bodily.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But if the adversary of all evil
<lb/>Was courteous, thinking of the high effect
<lb/>That issue would from him, and who, and what,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>To men of intellect unmeet it seems not;
<lb/>For he was of great Rome, and of her empire
<lb/>In the empyreal heaven as father chosen;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The which and what, wishing to speak the truth,
<lb/>Were stablished as the holy place, wherein
<lb/>Sits the successor of the greatest Peter.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Upon this journey, whence thou givest him vaunt,
<lb/>Things did he hear, which the occasion were
<lb/>Both of his victory and the papal mantle.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thither went afterwards the Chosen Vessel,
<lb/>To bring back comfort thence unto that Faith,
<lb/>Which of salvation's way is the beginning.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But I, why thither come, or who concedes it?
<lb/>I not Aeneas am, I am not Paul,
<lb/>Nor I, nor others, think me worthy of it.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Therefore, if I resign myself to come,
<lb/>I fear the coming may be ill-advised;
<lb/>Thou'rt wise, and knowest better than I speak."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And as he is, who unwills what he willed,
<lb/>And by new thoughts doth his intention change,
<lb/>So that from his design he quite withdraws,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Such I became, upon that dark hillside,
<lb/>Because, in thinking, I consumed the emprise,
<lb/>Which was so very prompt in the beginning.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"If I have well thy language understood,"
<lb/>Replied that shade of the Magnanimous,
<lb/>"Thy soul attainted is with cowardice,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Which many times a man encumbers so,
<lb/>It turns him back from honoured enterprise,
<lb/>As false sight doth a beast, when he is shy.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>That thou mayst free thee from this apprehension,
<lb/>I'll tell thee why I came, and what I heard
<lb/>At the first moment when I grieved for thee.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Among those was I who are in suspense,
<lb/>And a fair, saintly Lady called to me
<lb/>In such wise, I besought her to command me.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Her eyes where shining brighter than the Star;
<lb/>And she began to say, gentle and low,
<lb/>With voice angelical, in her own language:
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>'O spirit courteous of Mantua,
<lb/>Of whom the fame still in the world endures,
<lb/>And shall endure, long-lasting as the world;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>A friend of mine, and not the friend of fortune,
<lb/>Upon the desert slope is so impeded
<lb/>Upon his way, that he has turned through terror,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And may, I fear, already be so lost,
<lb/>That I too late have risen to his succour,
<lb/>From that which I have heard of him in Heaven.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Bestir thee now, and with thy speech ornate,
<lb/>And with what needful is for his release,
<lb/>Assist him so, that I may be consoled.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Beatrice am I, who do bid thee go;
<lb/>I come from there, where I would fain return;
<lb/>Love moved me, which compelleth me to speak.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>When I shall be in presence of my Lord,
<lb/>Full often will I praise thee unto him.'
<lb/>Then paused she, and thereafter I began:
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>'O Lady of virtue, thou alone through whom
<lb/>The human race exceedeth all contained
<lb/>Within the heaven that has the lesser circles,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>So grateful unto me is thy commandment,
<lb/>To obey, if 'twere already done, were late;
<lb/>No farther need'st thou ope to me thy wish.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But the cause tell me why thou dost not shun
<lb/>The here descending down into this centre,
<lb/>From the vast place thou burnest to return to.'
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>'Since thou wouldst fain so inwardly discern,
<lb/>Briefly will I relate,' she answered me,
<lb/>'Why I am not afraid to enter here.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Of those things only should one be afraid
<lb/>Which have the power of doing others harm;
<lb/>Of the rest, no; because they are not fearful.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>God in his mercy such created me
<lb/>That misery of yours attains me not,
<lb/>Nor any flame assails me of this burning.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>A gentle Lady is in Heaven, who grieves
<lb/>At this impediment, to which I send thee,
<lb/>So that stern judgment there above is broken.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>In her entreaty she besought Lucia,
<lb/>And said, "Thy faithful one now stands in need
<lb/>Of thee, and unto thee I recommend him."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Lucia, foe of all that cruel is,
<lb/>Hastened away, and came unto the place
<lb/>Where I was sitting with the ancient Rachel.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Beatrice" said she, "the true praise of God,
<lb/>Why succourest thou not him, who loved thee so,
<lb/>For thee he issued from the vulgar herd?
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Dost thou not hear the pity of his plaint?
<lb/>Dost thou not see the death that combats him
<lb/>Beside that flood, where ocean has no vaunt?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Never were persons in the world so swift
<lb/>To work their weal and to escape their woe,
<lb/>As I, after such words as these were uttered,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Came hither downward from my blessed seat,
<lb/>Confiding in thy dignified discourse,
<lb/>Which honours thee, and those who've listened to it.'
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>After she thus had spoken unto me,
<lb/>Weeping, her shining eyes she turned away;
<lb/>Whereby she made me swifter in my coming;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And unto thee I came, as she desired;
<lb/>I have delivered thee from that wild beast,
<lb/>Which barred the beautiful mountain's short ascent.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>What is it, then?  Why, why dost thou delay?
<lb/>Why is such baseness bedded in thy heart?
<lb/>Daring and hardihood why hast thou not,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Seeing that three such Ladies benedight
<lb/>Are caring for thee in the court of Heaven,
<lb/>And so much good my speech doth promise thee?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Even as the flowerets, by nocturnal chill,
<lb/>Bowed down and closed, when the sun whitens them,
<lb/>Uplift themselves all open on their stems;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Such I became with my exhausted strength,
<lb/>And such good courage to my heart there coursed,
<lb/>That I began, like an intrepid person:
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"O she compassionate, who succoured me,
<lb/>And courteous thou, who hast obeyed so soon
<lb/>The words of truth which she addressed to thee!
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thou hast my heart so with desire disposed
<lb/>To the adventure, with these words of thine,
<lb/>That to my first intent I have returned.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Now go, for one sole will is in us both,
<lb/>Thou Leader, and thou Lord, and Master thou."
<lb/>Thus said I to him; and when he had moved,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I entered on the deep and savage way.
</stanza>

<canto numeral="III"/>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Through me the way is to the city dolent;
<lb/>Through me the way is to eternal dole;
<lb/>Through me the way among the people lost.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Justice incited my sublime Creator;
<lb/>Created me divine Omnipotence,
<lb/>The highest Wisdom and the primal Love.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Before me there were no created things,
<lb/>Only eterne, and I eternal last.
<lb/>All hope abandon, ye who enter in!"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>These words in sombre colour I beheld
<lb/>Written upon the summit of a gate;
<lb/>Whence I: "Their sense is, Master, hard to me!"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And he to me, as one experienced:
<lb/>"Here all suspicion needs must be abandoned,
<lb/>All cowardice must needs be here extinct.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>We to the place have come, where I have told thee
<lb/>Thou shalt behold the people dolorous
<lb/>Who have foregone the good of intellect."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And after he had laid his hand on mine
<lb/>With joyful mien, whence I was comforted,
<lb/>He led me in among the secret things.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>There sighs, complaints, and ululations loud
<lb/>Resounded through the air without a star,
<lb/>Whence I, at the beginning, wept thereat.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Languages diverse, horrible dialects,
<lb/>Accents of anger, words of agony,
<lb/>And voices high and hoarse, with sound of hands,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Made up a tumult that goes whirling on
<lb/>For ever in that air for ever black,
<lb/>Even as the sand doth, when the whirlwind breathes.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And I, who had my head with horror bound,
<lb/>Said: "Master, what is this which now I hear?
<lb/>What folk is this, which seems by pain so vanquished?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And he to me: "This miserable mode
<lb/>Maintain the melancholy souls of those
<lb/>Who lived withouten infamy or praise.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Commingled are they with that caitiff choir
<lb/>Of Angels, who have not rebellious been,
<lb/>Nor faithful were to God, but were for self.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The heavens expelled them, not to be less fair;
<lb/>Nor them the nethermore abyss receives,
<lb/>For glory none the damned would have from them."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And I: "O Master, what so grievous is
<lb/>To these, that maketh them lament so sore?"
<lb/>He answered: "I will tell thee very briefly.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>These have no longer any hope of death;
<lb/>And this blind life of theirs is so debased,
<lb/>They envious are of every other fate.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>No fame of them the world permits to be;
<lb/>Misericord and Justice both disdain them.
<lb/>Let us not speak of them, but look, and pass."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And I, who looked again, beheld a banner,
<lb/>Which, whirling round, ran on so rapidly,
<lb/>That of all pause it seemed to me indignant;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And after it there came so long a train
<lb/>Of people, that I ne'er would have believed
<lb/>That ever Death so many had undone.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>When some among them I had recognised,
<lb/>I looked, and I beheld the shade of him
<lb/>Who made through cowardice the great refusal.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Forthwith I comprehended, and was certain,
<lb/>That this the sect was of the caitiff wretches
<lb/>Hateful to God and to his enemies.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>These miscreants, who never were alive,
<lb/>Were naked, and were stung exceedingly
<lb/>By gadflies and by hornets that were there.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>These did their faces irrigate with blood,
<lb/>Which, with their tears commingled, at their feet
<lb/>By the disgusting worms was gathered up.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And when to gazing farther I betook me.
<lb/>People I saw on a great river's bank;
<lb/>Whence said I: "Master, now vouchsafe to me,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>That I may know who these are, and what law
<lb/>Makes them appear so ready to pass over,
<lb/>As I discern athwart the dusky light."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And he to me: "These things shall all be known
<lb/>To thee, as soon as we our footsteps stay
<lb/>Upon the dismal shore of Acheron."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then with mine eyes ashamed and downward cast,
<lb/>Fearing my words might irksome be to him,
<lb/>From speech refrained I till we reached the river.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And lo! towards us coming in a boat
<lb/>An old man, hoary with the hair of eld,
<lb/>Crying: "Woe unto you, ye souls depraved!
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Hope nevermore to look upon the heavens;
<lb/>I come to lead you to the other shore,
<lb/>To the eternal shades in heat and frost.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And thou, that yonder standest, living soul,
<lb/>Withdraw thee from these people, who are dead!"
<lb/>But when he saw that I did not withdraw,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>He said: "By other ways, by other ports
<lb/>Thou to the shore shalt come, not here, for passage;
<lb/>A lighter vessel needs must carry thee."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And unto him the Guide: "Vex thee not, Charon;
<lb/>It is so willed there where is power to do
<lb/>That which is willed; and farther question not."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thereat were quieted the fleecy cheeks
<lb/>Of him the ferryman of the livid fen,
<lb/>Who round about his eyes had wheels of flame.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But all those souls who weary were and naked
<lb/>Their colour changed and gnashed their teeth together,
<lb/>As soon as they had heard those cruel words.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>God they blasphemed and their progenitors,
<lb/>The human race, the place, the time, the seed
<lb/>Of their engendering and of their birth!
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thereafter all together they drew back,
<lb/>Bitterly weeping, to the accursed shore,
<lb/>Which waiteth every man who fears not God.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Charon the demon, with the eyes of glede,
<lb/>Beckoning to them, collects them all together,
<lb/>Beats with his oar whoever lags behind.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>As in the autumn-time the leaves fall off,
<lb/>First one and then another, till the branch
<lb/>Unto the earth surrenders all its spoils;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>In similar wise the evil seed of Adam
<lb/>Throw themselves from that margin one by one,
<lb/>At signals, as a bird unto its lure.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>So they depart across the dusky wave,
<lb/>And ere upon the other side they land,
<lb/>Again on this side a new troop assembles.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"My son," the courteous Master said to me,
<lb/>"All those who perish in the wrath of God
<lb/>Here meet together out of every land;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And ready are they to pass o'er the river,
<lb/>Because celestial Justice spurs them on,
<lb/>So that their fear is turned into desire.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>This way there never passes a good soul;
<lb/>And hence if Charon doth complain of thee,
<lb/>Well mayst thou know now what his speech imports."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>This being finished, all the dusk champaign
<lb/>Trembled so violently, that of that terror
<lb/>The recollection bathes me still with sweat.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The land of tears gave forth a blast of wind,
<lb/>And fulminated a vermilion light,
<lb/>Which overmastered in me every sense,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And as a man whom sleep hath seized I fell.
</stanza>

<circle number="1" main_sin="not_christian">

<canto numeral="IV"/>

<stanza>
<lb/>Broke the deep lethargy within my head
<lb/>A heavy thunder, so that I upstarted,
<lb/>Like to a person who by force is wakened;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And round about I moved my rested eyes,
<lb/>Uprisen erect, and steadfastly I gazed,
<lb/>To recognise the place wherein I was.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>True is it, that upon the verge I found me
<lb/>Of the abysmal valley dolorous,
<lb/>That gathers thunder of infinite ululations.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Obscure, profound it was, and nebulous,
<lb/>So that by fixing on its depths my sight
<lb/>Nothing whatever I discerned therein.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Let us descend now into the blind world,"
<lb/>Began the Poet, pallid utterly;
<lb/>"I will be first, and thou shalt second be."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And I, who of his colour was aware,
<lb/>Said: "How shall I come, if thou art afraid,
<lb/>Who'rt wont to be a comfort to my fears?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And he to me: "The anguish of the people
<lb/>Who are below here in my face depicts
<lb/>That pity which for terror thou hast taken.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Let us go on, for the long way impels us."
<lb/>Thus he went in, and thus he made me enter
<lb/>The foremost circle that surrounds the abyss.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>There, as it seemed to me from listening,
<lb/>Were lamentations none, but only sighs,
<lb/>That tremble made the everlasting air.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And this arose from sorrow without torment,
<lb/>Which the crowds had, that many were and great,
<lb/>Of infants and of women and of men.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>To me the Master good: "Thou dost not ask
<lb/>What spirits these, which thou beholdest, are?
<lb/>Now will I have thee know, ere thou go farther,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>That they sinned not; and if they merit had,
<lb/>'Tis not enough, because they had not baptism
<lb/>Which is the portal of the Faith thou holdest;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And if they were before Christianity,
<lb/>In the right manner they adored not God;
<lb/>And among such as these am I myself.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>For such defects, and not for other guilt,
<lb/>Lost are we and are only so far punished,
<lb/>That without hope we live on in desire."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Great grief seized on my heart when this I heard,
<lb/>Because some people of much worthiness
<lb/>I knew, who in that Limbo were suspended.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Tell me, my Master, tell me, thou my Lord,"
<lb/>Began I, with desire of being certain
<lb/>Of that Faith which o'ercometh every error,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Came any one by his own merit hence,
<lb/>Or by another's, who was blessed thereafter?"
<lb/>And he, who understood my covert speech,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Replied: "I was a novice in this state,
<lb/>When I saw hither come a Mighty One,
<lb/>With sign of victory incoronate.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Hence he drew forth the shade of the First Parent,
<lb/>And that of his son Abel, and of Noah,
<lb/>Of Moses the lawgiver, and the obedient
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Abraham, patriarch, and David, king,
<lb/>Israel with his father and his children,
<lb/>And Rachel, for whose sake he did so much,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And others many, and he made them blessed;
<lb/>And thou must know, that earlier than these
<lb/>Never were any human spirits saved."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>We ceased not to advance because he spake,
<lb/>But still were passing onward through the forest,
<lb/>The forest, say I, of thick-crowded ghosts.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Not very far as yet our way had gone
<lb/>This side the summit, when I saw a fire
<lb/>That overcame a hemisphere of darkness.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>We were a little distant from it still,
<lb/>But not so far that I in part discerned not
<lb/>That honourable people held that place.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"O thou who honourest every art and science,
<lb/>Who may these be, which such great honour have,
<lb/>That from the fashion of the rest it parts them?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And he to me: "The honourable name,
<lb/>That sounds of them above there in thy life,
<lb/>Wins grace in Heaven, that so advances them."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>In the mean time a voice was heard by me:
<lb/>"All honour be to the pre-eminent Poet;
<lb/>His shade returns again, that was departed."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>After the voice had ceased and quiet was,
<lb/>Four mighty shades I saw approaching us;
<lb/>Semblance had they nor sorrowful nor glad.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>To say to me began my gracious Master:
<lb/>"Him with that falchion in his hand behold,
<lb/>Who comes before the three, even as their lord.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>That one is Homer, Poet sovereign;
<lb/>He who comes next is Horace, the satirist;
<lb/>The third is Ovid, and the last is Lucan.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Because to each of these with me applies
<lb/>The name that solitary voice proclaimed,
<lb/>They do me honour, and in that do well."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thus I beheld assemble the fair school
<lb/>Of that lord of the song pre-eminent,
<lb/>Who o'er the others like an eagle soars.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>When they together had discoursed somewhat,
<lb/>They turned to me with signs of salutation,
<lb/>And on beholding this, my Master smiled;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And more of honour still, much more, they did me,
<lb/>In that they made me one of their own band;
<lb/>So that the sixth was I, 'mid so much wit.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thus we went on as far as to the light,
<lb/>Things saying 'tis becoming to keep silent,
<lb/>As was the saying of them where I was.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>We came unto a noble castle's foot,
<lb/>Seven times encompassed with lofty walls,
<lb/>Defended round by a fair rivulet;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>This we passed over even as firm ground;
<lb/>Through portals seven I entered with these Sages;
<lb/>We came into a meadow of fresh verdure.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>People were there with solemn eyes and slow,
<lb/>Of great authority in their countenance;
<lb/>They spake but seldom, and with gentle voices.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thus we withdrew ourselves upon one side
<lb/>Into an opening luminous and lofty,
<lb/>So that they all of them were visible.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>There opposite, upon the green enamel,
<lb/>Were pointed out to me the mighty spirits,
<lb/>Whom to have seen I feel myself exalted.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I saw Electra with companions many,
<lb/>'Mongst whom I knew both Hector and Aeneas,
<lb/>Caesar in armour with gerfalcon eyes;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I saw Camilla and Penthesilea
<lb/>On the other side, and saw the King Latinus,
<lb/>Who with Lavinia his daughter sat;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I saw that Brutus who drove Tarquin forth,
<lb/>Lucretia, Julia, Marcia, and Cornelia,
<lb/>And saw alone, apart, the Saladin.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>When I had lifted up my brows a little,
<lb/>The Master I beheld of those who know,
<lb/>Sit with his philosophic family.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>All gaze upon him, and all do him honour.
<lb/>There I beheld both Socrates and Plato,
<lb/>Who nearer him before the others stand;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Democritus, who puts the world on chance,
<lb/>Diogenes, Anaxagoras, and Thales,
<lb/>Zeno, Empedocles, and Heraclitus;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Of qualities I saw the good collector,
<lb/>Hight Dioscorides; and Orpheus saw I,
<lb/>Tully and Livy, and moral Seneca,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Euclid, geometrician, and Ptolemy,
<lb/>Galen, Hippocrates, and Avicenna,
<lb/>Averroes, who the great Comment made.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I cannot all of them pourtray in full,
<lb/>Because so drives me onward the long theme,
<lb/>That many times the word comes short of fact.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The sixfold company in two divides;
<lb/>Another way my sapient Guide conducts me
<lb/>Forth from the quiet to the air that trembles;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And to a place I come where nothing shines.
</stanza>
    
</circle>

<circle number="2" main_sin="lustful">

<canto numeral="V"/>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thus I descended out of the first circle
<lb/>Down to the second, that less space begirds,
<lb/>And so much greater dole, that goads to wailing.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>There standeth Minos horribly, and snarls;
<lb/>Examines the transgressions at the entrance;
<lb/>Judges, and sends according as he girds him.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I say, that when the spirit evil-born
<lb/>Cometh before him, wholly it confesses;
<lb/>And this discriminator of transgressions
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Seeth what place in Hell is meet for it;
<lb/>Girds himself with his tail as many times
<lb/>As grades he wishes it should be thrust down.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Always before him many of them stand;
<lb/>They go by turns each one unto the judgment;
<lb/>They speak, and hear, and then are downward hurled.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"O thou, that to this dolorous hostelry
<lb/>Comest," said Minos to me, when he saw me,
<lb/>Leaving the practice of so great an office,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Look how thou enterest, and in whom thou trustest;
<lb/>Let not the portal's amplitude deceive thee."
<lb/>And unto him my Guide: "Why criest thou too?
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Do not impede his journey fate-ordained;
<lb/>It is so willed there where is power to do
<lb/>That which is willed; and ask no further question."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And now begin the dolesome notes to grow
<lb/>Audible unto me; now am I come
<lb/>There where much lamentation strikes upon me.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I came into a place mute of all light,
<lb/>Which bellows as the sea does in a tempest,
<lb/>If by opposing winds 't is combated.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The infernal hurricane that never rests
<lb/>Hurtles the spirits onward in its rapine;
<lb/>Whirling them round, and smiting, it molests them.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>When they arrive before the precipice,
<lb/>There are the shrieks, the plaints, and the laments,
<lb/>There they blaspheme the puissance divine.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I understood that unto such a torment
<lb/>The carnal malefactors were condemned,
<lb/>Who reason subjugate to appetite.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And as the wings of starlings bear them on
<lb/>In the cold season in large band and full,
<lb/>So doth that blast the spirits maledict;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>It hither, thither, downward, upward, drives them;
<lb/>No hope doth comfort them for evermore,
<lb/>Not of repose, but even of lesser pain.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And as the cranes go chanting forth their lays,
<lb/>Making in air a long line of themselves,
<lb/>So saw I coming, uttering lamentations,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Shadows borne onward by the aforesaid stress.
<lb/>Whereupon said I: "Master, who are those
<lb/>People, whom the black air so castigates?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"The first of those, of whom intelligence
<lb/>Thou fain wouldst have," then said he unto me,
<lb/>"The empress was of many languages.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>To sensual vices she was so abandoned,
<lb/>That lustful she made licit in her law,
<lb/>To remove the blame to which she had been led.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>She is Semiramis, of whom we read
<lb/>That she succeeded Ninus, and was his spouse;
<lb/>She held the land which now the Sultan rules.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The next is she who killed herself for love,
<lb/>And broke faith with the ashes of Sichaeus;
<lb/>Then Cleopatra the voluptuous."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Helen I saw, for whom so many ruthless
<lb/>Seasons revolved; and saw the great Achilles,
<lb/>Who at the last hour combated with Love.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Paris I saw, Tristan; and more than a thousand
<lb/>Shades did he name and point out with his finger,
<lb/>Whom Love had separated from our life.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>After that I had listened to my Teacher,
<lb/>Naming the dames of eld and cavaliers,
<lb/>Pity prevailed, and I was nigh bewildered.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And I began: "O Poet, willingly
<lb/>Speak would I to those two, who go together,
<lb/>And seem upon the wind to be so light."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And, he to me: "Thou'lt mark, when they shall be
<lb/>Nearer to us; and then do thou implore them
<lb/>By love which leadeth them, and they will come."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Soon as the wind in our direction sways them,
<lb/>My voice uplift I: "O ye weary souls!
<lb/>Come speak to us, if no one interdicts it."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>As turtle-doves, called onward by desire,
<lb/>With open and steady wings to the sweet nest
<lb/>Fly through the air by their volition borne,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>So came they from the band where Dido is,
<lb/>Approaching us athwart the air malign,
<lb/>So strong was the affectionate appeal.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"O living creature gracious and benignant,
<lb/>Who visiting goest through the purple air
<lb/>Us, who have stained the world incarnadine,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>If were the King of the Universe our friend,
<lb/>We would pray unto him to give thee peace,
<lb/>Since thou hast pity on our woe perverse.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Of what it pleases thee to hear and speak,
<lb/>That will we hear, and we will speak to you,
<lb/>While silent is the wind, as it is now.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Sitteth the city, wherein I was born,
<lb/>Upon the sea-shore where the Po descends
<lb/>To rest in peace with all his retinue.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Love, that on gentle heart doth swiftly seize,
<lb/>Seized this man for the person beautiful
<lb/>That was ta'en from me, and still the mode offends me.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Love, that exempts no one beloved from loving,
<lb/>Seized me with pleasure of this man so strongly,
<lb/>That, as thou seest, it doth not yet desert me;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Love has conducted us unto one death;
<lb/>Caina waiteth him who quenched our life!"
<lb/>These words were borne along from them to us.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>As soon as I had heard those souls tormented,
<lb/>I bowed my face, and so long held it down
<lb/>Until the Poet said to me: "What thinkest?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>When I made answer, I began: "Alas!
<lb/>How many pleasant thoughts, how much desire,
<lb/>Conducted these unto the dolorous pass!"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then unto them I turned me, and I spake,
<lb/>And I began: "Thine agonies, Francesca,
<lb/>Sad and compassionate to weeping make me.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But tell me, at the time of those sweet sighs,
<lb/>By what and in what manner Love conceded,
<lb/>That you should know your dubious desires?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And she to me: "There is no greater sorrow
<lb/>Than to be mindful of the happy time
<lb/>In misery, and that thy Teacher knows.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But, if to recognise the earliest root
<lb/>Of love in us thou hast so great desire,
<lb/>I will do even as he who weeps and speaks.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>One day we reading were for our delight
<lb/>Of Launcelot, how Love did him enthral.
<lb/>Alone we were and without any fear.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Full many a time our eyes together drew
<lb/>That reading, and drove the colour from our faces;
<lb/>But one point only was it that o'ercame us.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>When as we read of the much-longed-for smile
<lb/>Being by such a noble lover kissed,
<lb/>This one, who ne'er from me shall be divided,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Kissed me upon the mouth all palpitating.
<lb/>Galeotto was the book and he who wrote it.
<lb/>That day no farther did we read therein."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And all the while one spirit uttered this,
<lb/>The other one did weep so, that, for pity,
<lb/>I swooned away as if I had been dying,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And fell, even as a dead body falls.
</stanza>

</circle>

<circle number="3" main_sin="gluttonous">

<stanza>
<lb/>At the return of consciousness, that closed
<lb/>Before the pity of those two relations,
<lb/>Which utterly with sadness had confused me,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>New torments I behold, and new tormented
<lb/>Around me, whichsoever way I move,
<lb/>And whichsoever way I turn, and gaze.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>In the third circle am I of the rain
<lb/>Eternal, maledict, and cold, and heavy;
<lb/>Its law and quality are never new.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Huge hail, and water sombre-hued, and snow,
<lb/>Athwart the tenebrous air pour down amain;
<lb/>Noisome the earth is, that receiveth this.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Cerberus, monster cruel and uncouth,
<lb/>With his three gullets like a dog is barking
<lb/>Over the people that are there submerged.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Red eyes he has, and unctuous beard and black,
<lb/>And belly large, and armed with claws his hands;
<lb/>He rends the spirits, flays, and quarters them.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Howl the rain maketh them like unto dogs;
<lb/>One side they make a shelter for the other;
<lb/>Oft turn themselves the wretched reprobates.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>When Cerberus perceived us, the great worm!
<lb/>His mouths he opened, and displayed his tusks;
<lb/>Not a limb had he that was motionless.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And my Conductor, with his spans extended,
<lb/>Took of the earth, and with his fists well filled,
<lb/>He threw it into those rapacious gullets.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Such as that dog is, who by barking craves,
<lb/>And quiet grows soon as his food he gnaws,
<lb/>For to devour it he but thinks and struggles,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The like became those muzzles filth-begrimed
<lb/>Of Cerberus the demon, who so thunders
<lb/>Over the souls that they would fain be deaf.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>We passed across the shadows, which subdues
<lb/>The heavy rain-storm, and we placed our feet
<lb/>Upon their vanity that person seems.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>They all were lying prone upon the earth,
<lb/>Excepting one, who sat upright as soon
<lb/>As he beheld us passing on before him.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"O thou that art conducted through this Hell,"
<lb/>He said to me, "recall me, if thou canst;
<lb/>Thyself wast made before I was unmade."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And I to him: "The anguish which thou hast
<lb/>Perhaps doth draw thee out of my remembrance,
<lb/>So that it seems not I have ever seen thee.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But tell me who thou art, that in so doleful
<lb/>A place art put, and in such punishment,
<lb/>If some are greater, none is so displeasing."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And he to me: "Thy city, which is full
<lb/>Of envy so that now the sack runs over,
<lb/>Held me within it in the life serene.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>You citizens were wont to call me Ciacco;
<lb/>For the pernicious sin of gluttony
<lb/>I, as thou seest, am battered by this rain.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And I, sad soul, am not the only one,
<lb/>For all these suffer the like penalty
<lb/>For the like sin;" and word no more spake he.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I answered him: "Ciacco, thy wretchedness
<lb/>Weighs on me so that it to weep invites me;
<lb/>But tell me, if thou knowest, to what shall come
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The citizens of the divided city;
<lb/>If any there be just; and the occasion
<lb/>Tell me why so much discord has assailed it."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And he to me: "They, after long contention,
<lb/>Will come to bloodshed; and the rustic party
<lb/>Will drive the other out with much offence.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then afterwards behoves it this one fall
<lb/>Within three suns, and rise again the other
<lb/>By force of him who now is on the coast.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>High will it hold its forehead a long while,
<lb/>Keeping the other under heavy burdens,
<lb/>Howe'er it weeps thereat and is indignant.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The just are two, and are not understood there;
<lb/>Envy and Arrogance and Avarice
<lb/>Are the three sparks that have all hearts enkindled."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Here ended he his tearful utterance;
<lb/>And I to him: "I wish thee still to teach me,
<lb/>And make a gift to me of further speech.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Farinata and Tegghiaio, once so worthy,
<lb/>Jacopo Rusticucci, Arrigo, and Mosca,
<lb/>And others who on good deeds set their thoughts,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Say where they are, and cause that I may know them;
<lb/>For great desire constraineth me to learn
<lb/>If Heaven doth sweeten them, or Hell envenom."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And he: "They are among the blacker souls;
<lb/>A different sin downweighs them to the bottom;
<lb/>If thou so far descendest, thou canst see them.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But when thou art again in the sweet world,
<lb/>I pray thee to the mind of others bring me;
<lb/>No more I tell thee and no more I answer."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then his straightforward eyes he turned askance,
<lb/>Eyed me a little, and then bowed his head;
<lb/>He fell therewith prone like the other blind.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And the Guide said to me: "He wakes no more
<lb/>This side the sound of the angelic trumpet;
<lb/>When shall approach the hostile Potentate,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Each one shall find again his dismal tomb,
<lb/>Shall reassume his flesh and his own figure,
<lb/>Shall hear what through eternity re-echoes."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>So we passed onward o'er the filthy mixture
<lb/>Of shadows and of rain with footsteps slow,
<lb/>Touching a little on the future life.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Wherefore I said: "Master, these torments here,
<lb/>Will they increase after the mighty sentence,
<lb/>Or lesser be, or will they be as burning?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And he to me: "Return unto thy science,
<lb/>Which wills, that as the thing more perfect is,
<lb/>The more it feels of pleasure and of pain.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Albeit that this people maledict
<lb/>To true perfection never can attain,
<lb/>Hereafter more than now they look to be."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Round in a circle by that road we went,
<lb/>Speaking much more, which I do not repeat;
<lb/>We came unto the point where the descent is;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>There we found Plutus the great enemy.
</stanza>
    
</circle>
        
<circle number="4" main_sin="avaricious_prodigal">    

<canto numeral="VII"/>
    
<stanza>
<lb/>"Pape Satan, Pape Satan, Aleppe!"
<lb/>Thus Plutus with his clucking voice began;
<lb/>And that benignant Sage, who all things knew,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Said, to encourage me: "Let not thy fear
<lb/>Harm thee; for any power that he may have
<lb/>Shall not prevent thy going down this crag."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then he turned round unto that bloated lip,
<lb/>And said: "Be silent, thou accursed wolf;
<lb/>Consume within thyself with thine own rage.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Not causeless is this journey to the abyss;
<lb/>Thus is it willed on high, where Michael wrought
<lb/>Vengeance upon the proud adultery."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Even as the sails inflated by the wind
<lb/>Involved together fall when snaps the mast,
<lb/>So fell the cruel monster to the earth.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thus we descended into the fourth chasm,
<lb/>Gaining still farther on the dolesome shore
<lb/>Which all the woe of the universe insacks.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Justice of God, ah! who heaps up so many
<lb/>New toils and sufferings as I beheld?
<lb/>And why doth our transgression waste us so?
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>As doth the billow there upon Charybdis,
<lb/>That breaks itself on that which it encounters,
<lb/>So here the folk must dance their roundelay.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Here saw I people, more than elsewhere, many,
<lb/>On one side and the other, with great howls,
<lb/>Rolling weights forward by main force of chest.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>They clashed together, and then at that point
<lb/>Each one turned backward, rolling retrograde,
<lb/>Crying, "Why keepest?" and, "Why squanderest thou?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thus they returned along the lurid circle
<lb/>On either hand unto the opposite point,
<lb/>Shouting their shameful metre evermore.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then each, when he arrived there, wheeled about
<lb/>Through his half-circle to another joust;
<lb/>And I, who had my heart pierced as it were,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Exclaimed: "My Master, now declare to me
<lb/>What people these are, and if all were clerks,
<lb/>These shaven crowns upon the left of us."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And he to me: "All of them were asquint
<lb/>In intellect in the first life, so much
<lb/>That there with measure they no spending made.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Clearly enough their voices bark it forth,
<lb/>Whene'er they reach the two points of the circle,
<lb/>Where sunders them the opposite defect.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Clerks those were who no hairy covering
<lb/>Have on the head, and Popes and Cardinals,
<lb/>In whom doth Avarice practise its excess."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And I: "My Master, among such as these
<lb/>I ought forsooth to recognise some few,
<lb/>Who were infected with these maladies."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And he to me: "Vain thought thou entertainest;
<lb/>The undiscerning life which made them sordid
<lb/>Now makes them unto all discernment dim.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Forever shall they come to these two buttings;
<lb/>These from the sepulchre shall rise again
<lb/>With the fist closed, and these with tresses shorn.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Ill giving and ill keeping the fair world
<lb/>Have ta'en from them, and placed them in this scuffle;
<lb/>Whate'er it be, no words adorn I for it.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Now canst thou, Son, behold the transient farce
<lb/>Of goods that are committed unto Fortune,
<lb/>For which the human race each other buffet;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>For all the gold that is beneath the moon,
<lb/>Or ever has been, of these weary souls
<lb/>Could never make a single one repose."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Master," I said to him, "now tell me also
<lb/>What is this Fortune which thou speakest of,
<lb/>That has the world's goods so within its clutches?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And he to me: "O creatures imbecile,
<lb/>What ignorance is this which doth beset you?
<lb/>Now will I have thee learn my judgment of her.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>He whose omniscience everything transcends
<lb/>The heavens created, and gave who should guide them,
<lb/>That every part to every part may shine,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Distributing the light in equal measure;
<lb/>He in like manner to the mundane splendours
<lb/>Ordained a general ministress and guide,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>That she might change at times the empty treasures
<lb/>From race to race, from one blood to another,
<lb/>Beyond resistance of all human wisdom.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Therefore one people triumphs, and another
<lb/>Languishes, in pursuance of her judgment,
<lb/>Which hidden is, as in the grass a serpent.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Your knowledge has no counterstand against her;
<lb/>She makes provision, judges, and pursues
<lb/>Her governance, as theirs the other gods.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Her permutations have not any truce;
<lb/>Necessity makes her precipitate,
<lb/>So often cometh who his turn obtains.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And this is she who is so crucified
<lb/>Even by those who ought to give her praise,
<lb/>Giving her blame amiss, and bad repute.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But she is blissful, and she hears it not;
<lb/>Among the other primal creatures gladsome
<lb/>She turns her sphere, and blissful she rejoices.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Let us descend now unto greater woe;
<lb/>Already sinks each star that was ascending
<lb/>When I set out, and loitering is forbidden."
</stanza>
    
</circle>
    
<circle number="5" main_sin="wrathful_sullen">

<stanza>
<lb/>We crossed the circle to the other bank,
<lb/>Near to a fount that boils, and pours itself
<lb/>Along a gully that runs out of it.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The water was more sombre far than perse;
<lb/>And we, in company with the dusky waves,
<lb/>Made entrance downward by a path uncouth.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>A marsh it makes, which has the name of Styx,
<lb/>This tristful brooklet, when it has descended
<lb/>Down to the foot of the malign gray shores.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And I, who stood intent upon beholding,
<lb/>Saw people mud-besprent in that lagoon,
<lb/>All of them naked and with angry look.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>They smote each other not alone with hands,
<lb/>But with the head and with the breast and feet,
<lb/>Tearing each other piecemeal with their teeth.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Said the good Master: "Son, thou now beholdest
<lb/>The souls of those whom anger overcame;
<lb/>And likewise I would have thee know for certain
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Beneath the water people are who sigh
<lb/>And make this water bubble at the surface,
<lb/>As the eye tells thee wheresoe'er it turns.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Fixed in the mire they say, 'We sullen were
<lb/>In the sweet air, which by the sun is gladdened,
<lb/>Bearing within ourselves the sluggish reek;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Now we are sullen in this sable mire.'
<lb/>This hymn do they keep gurgling in their throats,
<lb/>For with unbroken words they cannot say it."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thus we went circling round the filthy fen
<lb/>A great arc 'twixt the dry bank and the swamp,
<lb/>With eyes turned unto those who gorge the mire;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Unto the foot of a tower we came at last.
</stanza>

<canto numeral="VIII"/>

<stanza>
<lb/>I say, continuing, that long before
<lb/>We to the foot of that high tower had come,
<lb/>Our eyes went upward to the summit of it,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>By reason of two flamelets we saw placed there,
<lb/>And from afar another answer them,
<lb/>So far, that hardly could the eye attain it.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And, to the sea of all discernment turned,
<lb/>I said: "What sayeth this, and what respondeth
<lb/>That other fire? and who are they that made it?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And he to me: "Across the turbid waves
<lb/>What is expected thou canst now discern,
<lb/>If reek of the morass conceal it not."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Cord never shot an arrow from itself
<lb/>That sped away athwart the air so swift,
<lb/>As I beheld a very little boat
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Come o'er the water tow'rds us at that moment,
<lb/>Under the guidance of a single pilot,
<lb/>Who shouted, "Now art thou arrived, fell soul?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Phlegyas, Phlegyas, thou criest out in vain
<lb/>For this once," said my Lord; "thou shalt not have us
<lb/>Longer than in the passing of the slough."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>As he who listens to some great deceit
<lb/>That has been done to him, and then resents it,
<lb/>Such became Phlegyas, in his gathered wrath.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>My Guide descended down into the boat,
<lb/>And then he made me enter after him,
<lb/>And only when I entered seemed it laden.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Soon as the Guide and I were in the boat,
<lb/>The antique prow goes on its way, dividing
<lb/>More of the water than 'tis wont with others.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>While we were running through the dead canal,
<lb/>Uprose in front of me one full of mire,
<lb/>And said, "Who 'rt thou that comest ere the hour?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And I to him: "Although I come, I stay not;
<lb/>But who art thou that hast become so squalid?"
<lb/>"Thou seest that I am one who weeps," he answered.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And I to him: "With weeping and with wailing,
<lb/>Thou spirit maledict, do thou remain;
<lb/>For thee I know, though thou art all defiled."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then stretched he both his hands unto the boat;
<lb/>Whereat my wary Master thrust him back,
<lb/>Saying, "Away there with the other dogs!"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thereafter with his arms he clasped my neck;
<lb/>He kissed my face, and said: "Disdainful soul,
<lb/>Blessed be she who bore thee in her bosom.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>That was an arrogant person in the world;
<lb/>Goodness is none, that decks his memory;
<lb/>So likewise here his shade is furious.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>How many are esteemed great kings up there,
<lb/>Who here shall be like unto swine in mire,
<lb/>Leaving behind them horrible dispraises!"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And I: "My Master, much should I be pleased,
<lb/>If I could see him soused into this broth,
<lb/>Before we issue forth out of the lake."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And he to me: "Ere unto thee the shore
<lb/>Reveal itself, thou shalt be satisfied;
<lb/>Such a desire 'tis meet thou shouldst enjoy."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>A little after that, I saw such havoc
<lb/>Made of him by the people of the mire,
<lb/>That still I praise and thank my God for it.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>They all were shouting, "At Philippo Argenti!"
<lb/>And that exasperate spirit Florentine
<lb/>Turned round upon himself with his own teeth.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>We left him there, and more of him I tell not;
<lb/>But on mine ears there smote a lamentation,
<lb/>Whence forward I intent unbar mine eyes.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And the good Master said: "Even now, my Son,
<lb/>The city draweth near whose name is Dis,
<lb/>With the grave citizens, with the great throng."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And I: "Its mosques already, Master, clearly
<lb/>Within there in the valley I discern
<lb/>Vermilion, as if issuing from the fire
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>They were."  And he to me: "The fire eternal
<lb/>That kindles them within makes them look red,
<lb/>As thou beholdest in this nether Hell."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then we arrived within the moats profound,
<lb/>That circumvallate that disconsolate city;
<lb/>The walls appeared to me to be of iron.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Not without making first a circuit wide,
<lb/>We came unto a place where loud the pilot
<lb/>Cried out to us, "Debark, here is the entrance."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>More than a thousand at the gates I saw
<lb/>Out of the Heavens rained down, who angrily
<lb/>Were saying, "Who is this that without death
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Goes through the kingdom of the people dead?"
<lb/>And my sagacious Master made a sign
<lb/>Of wishing secretly to speak with them.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>A little then they quelled their great disdain,
<lb/>And said: "Come thou alone, and he begone
<lb/>Who has so boldly entered these dominions.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Let him return alone by his mad road;
<lb/>Try, if he can; for thou shalt here remain,
<lb/>Who hast escorted him through such dark regions."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Think, Reader, if I was discomforted
<lb/>At utterance of the accursed words;
<lb/>For never to return here I believed.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"O my dear Guide, who more than seven times
<lb/>Hast rendered me security, and drawn me
<lb/>From imminent peril that before me stood,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Do not desert me," said I, "thus undone;
<lb/>And if the going farther be denied us,
<lb/>Let us retrace our steps together swiftly."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And that Lord, who had led me thitherward,
<lb/>Said unto me: "Fear not; because our passage
<lb/>None can take from us, it by Such is given.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But here await me, and thy weary spirit
<lb/>Comfort and nourish with a better hope;
<lb/>For in this nether world I will not leave thee."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>So onward goes and there abandons me
<lb/>My Father sweet, and I remain in doubt,
<lb/>For No and Yes within my head contend.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I could not hear what he proposed to them;
<lb/>But with them there he did not linger long,
<lb/>Ere each within in rivalry ran back.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>They closed the portals, those our adversaries,
<lb/>On my Lord's breast, who had remained without
<lb/>And turned to me with footsteps far between.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>His eyes cast down, his forehead shorn had he
<lb/>Of all its boldness, and he said, with sighs,
<lb/>"Who has denied to me the dolesome houses?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And unto me: "Thou, because I am angry,
<lb/>Fear not, for I will conquer in the trial,
<lb/>Whatever for defence within be planned.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>This arrogance of theirs is nothing new;
<lb/>For once they used it at less secret gate,
<lb/>Which finds itself without a fastening still.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>O'er it didst thou behold the dead inscription;
<lb/>And now this side of it descends the steep,
<lb/>Passing across the circles without escort,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>One by whose means the city shall be opened."
</stanza>
    
</circle>

<circle number="6" main_sin="heretic">
        
<canto numeral="IX"/>

<stanza>
<lb/>That hue which cowardice brought out on me,
<lb/>Beholding my Conductor backward turn,
<lb/>Sooner repressed within him his new colour.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>He stopped attentive, like a man who listens,
<lb/>Because the eye could not conduct him far
<lb/>Through the black air, and through the heavy fog.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Still it behoveth us to win the fight,"
<lb/>Began he; "Else. . .Such offered us herself. . .
<lb/>O how I long that some one here arrive!"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Well I perceived, as soon as the beginning
<lb/>He covered up with what came afterward,
<lb/>That they were words quite different from the first;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But none the less his saying gave me fear,
<lb/>Because I carried out the broken phrase,
<lb/>Perhaps to a worse meaning than he had.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Into this bottom of the doleful conch
<lb/>Doth any e'er descend from the first grade,
<lb/>Which for its pain has only hope cut off?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>This question put I; and he answered me:
<lb/>"Seldom it comes to pass that one of us
<lb/>Maketh the journey upon which I go.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>True is it, once before I here below
<lb/>Was conjured by that pitiless Erictho,
<lb/>Who summoned back the shades unto their bodies.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Naked of me short while the flesh had been,
<lb/>Before within that wall she made me enter,
<lb/>To bring a spirit from the circle of Judas;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>That is the lowest region and the darkest,
<lb/>And farthest from the heaven which circles all.
<lb/>Well know I the way; therefore be reassured.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>This fen, which a prodigious stench exhales,
<lb/>Encompasses about the city dolent,
<lb/>Where now we cannot enter without anger."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And more he said, but not in mind I have it;
<lb/>Because mine eye had altogether drawn me
<lb/>Tow'rds the high tower with the red-flaming summit,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Where in a moment saw I swift uprisen
<lb/>The three infernal Furies stained with blood,
<lb/>Who had the limbs of women and their mien,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And with the greenest hydras were begirt;
<lb/>Small serpents and cerastes were their tresses,
<lb/>Wherewith their horrid temples were entwined.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And he who well the handmaids of the Queen
<lb/>Of everlasting lamentation knew,
<lb/>Said unto me: "Behold the fierce Erinnys.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>This is Megaera, on the left-hand side;
<lb/>She who is weeping on the right, Alecto;
<lb/>Tisiphone is between;" and then was silent.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Each one her breast was rending with her nails;
<lb/>They beat them with their palms, and cried so loud,
<lb/>That I for dread pressed close unto the Poet.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Medusa come, so we to stone will change him!"
<lb/>All shouted looking down; "in evil hour
<lb/>Avenged we not on Theseus his assault!"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Turn thyself round, and keep thine eyes close shut,
<lb/>For if the Gorgon appear, and thou shouldst see it,
<lb/>No more returning upward would there be."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thus said the Master; and he turned me round
<lb/>Himself, and trusted not unto my hands
<lb/>So far as not to blind me with his own.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>O ye who have undistempered intellects,
<lb/>Observe the doctrine that conceals itself
<lb/>Beneath the veil of the mysterious verses!
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And now there came across the turbid waves
<lb/>The clangour of a sound with terror fraught,
<lb/>Because of which both of the margins trembled;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Not otherwise it was than of a wind
<lb/>Impetuous on account of adverse heats,
<lb/>That smites the forest, and, without restraint,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The branches rends, beats down, and bears away;
<lb/>Right onward, laden with dust, it goes superb,
<lb/>And puts to flight the wild beasts and the shepherds.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Mine eyes he loosed, and said: "Direct the nerve
<lb/>Of vision now along that ancient foam,
<lb/>There yonder where that smoke is most intense."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Even as the frogs before the hostile serpent
<lb/>Across the water scatter all abroad,
<lb/>Until each one is huddled in the earth.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>More than a thousand ruined souls I saw,
<lb/>Thus fleeing from before one who on foot
<lb/>Was passing o'er the Styx with soles unwet.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>From off his face he fanned that unctuous air,
<lb/>Waving his left hand oft in front of him,
<lb/>And only with that anguish seemed he weary.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Well I perceived one sent from Heaven was he,
<lb/>And to the Master turned; and he made sign
<lb/>That I should quiet stand, and bow before him.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Ah! how disdainful he appeared to me!
<lb/>He reached the gate, and with a little rod
<lb/>He opened it, for there was no resistance.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"O banished out of Heaven, people despised!"
<lb/>Thus he began upon the horrid threshold;
<lb/>"Whence is this arrogance within you couched?
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Wherefore recalcitrate against that will,
<lb/>From which the end can never be cut off,
<lb/>And which has many times increased your pain?
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>What helpeth it to butt against the fates?
<lb/>Your Cerberus, if you remember well,
<lb/>For that still bears his chin and gullet peeled."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then he returned along the miry road,
<lb/>And spake no word to us, but had the look
<lb/>Of one whom other care constrains and goads
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Than that of him who in his presence is;
<lb/>And we our feet directed tow'rds the city,
<lb/>After those holy words all confident.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Within we entered without any contest;
<lb/>And I, who inclination had to see
<lb/>What the condition such a fortress holds,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Soon as I was within, cast round mine eye,
<lb/>And see on every hand an ample plain,
<lb/>Full of distress and torment terrible.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Even as at Arles, where stagnant grows the Rhone,
<lb/>Even as at Pola near to the Quarnaro,
<lb/>That shuts in Italy and bathes its borders,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The sepulchres make all the place uneven;
<lb/>So likewise did they there on every side,
<lb/>Saving that there the manner was more bitter;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/><punishment_phrase>For flames between the sepulchres were scattered,
<lb/>By which they so intensely heated were,
<lb/>That iron more so asks not any art.</punishment_phrase>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>All of their coverings uplifted were,
<lb/><punishment_phrase>And from them issued forth such dire laments,</punishment_phrase>
<lb/>Sooth seemed they of the wretched and tormented.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And I: "My Master, what are all those people
<lb/>Who, having sepulture within those tombs,
<lb/>Make themselves audible by doleful sighs?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And he to me: "Here are the Heresiarchs,
<lb/>With their disciples of all sects, and much
<lb/>More than thou thinkest laden are the tombs.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Here like together with its like is buried;
<lb/>And more and less the monuments are heated."
<lb/>And when he to the right had turned, we passed
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Between the torments and high parapets.
</stanza>

<canto numeral="X"/>

<stanza>
<lb/>Now onward goes, along a narrow path
<lb/>Between the torments and the city wall,
<lb/>My Master, and I follow at his back.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"O power supreme, that through these impious circles
<lb/>Turnest me," I began, "as pleases thee,
<lb/>Speak to me, and my longings satisfy;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The people who are lying in these tombs,
<lb/>Might they be seen? already are uplifted
<lb/>The covers all, and no one keepeth guard."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And he to me: "They all will be closed up
<lb/>When from Jehoshaphat they shall return
<lb/>Here with the bodies they have left above.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Their cemetery have upon this side
<lb/>With Epicurus all his followers,
<lb/>Who with the body mortal make the soul;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But in the question thou dost put to me,
<lb/>Within here shalt thou soon be satisfied,
<lb/>And likewise in the wish thou keepest silent."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And I: "Good Leader, I but keep concealed
<lb/>From thee my heart, that I may speak the less,
<lb/>Nor only now hast thou thereto disposed me."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"O Tuscan, thou who through the city of fire
<lb/>Goest alive, thus speaking modestly,
<lb/>Be pleased to stay thy footsteps in this place.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thy mode of speaking makes thee manifest
<lb/>A native of that noble fatherland,
<lb/>To which perhaps I too molestful was."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Upon a sudden issued forth this sound
<lb/>From out one of the tombs; wherefore I pressed,
<lb/>Fearing, a little nearer to my Leader.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And unto me he said: "Turn thee; what dost thou?
<lb/>Behold there Farinata who has risen;
<lb/>From the waist upwards wholly shalt thou see him."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I had already fixed mine eyes on his,
<lb/>And he uprose erect with breast and front
<lb/>E'en as if Hell he had in great despite.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And with courageous hands and prompt my Leader
<lb/>Thrust me between the sepulchres towards him,
<lb/>Exclaiming, "Let thy words explicit be."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>As soon as I was at the foot of his tomb
<lb/>Somewhat he eyed me, and, as if disdainful,
<lb/>Then asked of me, "Who were thine ancestors?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I, who desirous of obeying was,
<lb/>Concealed it not, but all revealed to him;
<lb/>Whereat he raised his brows a little upward.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then said he: "Fiercely adverse have they been
<lb/>To me, and to my fathers, and my party;
<lb/>So that two several times I scattered them."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"If they were banished, they returned on all sides,"
<lb/>I answered him, "the first time and the second;
<lb/>But yours have not acquired that art aright."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then there uprose upon the sight, uncovered
<lb/>Down to the chin, a shadow at his side;
<lb/>I think that he had risen on his knees.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Round me he gazed, as if solicitude
<lb/>He had to see if some one else were with me,
<lb/>But after his suspicion was all spent,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Weeping, he said to me: "If through this blind
<lb/>Prison thou goest by loftiness of genius,
<lb/>Where is my son? and why is he not with thee?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And I to him: "I come not of myself;
<lb/>He who is waiting yonder leads me here,
<lb/>Whom in disdain perhaps your Guido had."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>His language and the mode of punishment
<lb/>Already unto me had read his name;
<lb/>On that account my answer was so full.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Up starting suddenly, he cried out: "How
<lb/>Saidst thou,--he had?  Is he not still alive?
<lb/>Does not the sweet light strike upon his eyes?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>When he became aware of some delay,
<lb/>Which I before my answer made, supine
<lb/>He fell again, and forth appeared no more.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But the other, magnanimous, at whose desire
<lb/>I had remained, did not his aspect change,
<lb/>Neither his neck he moved, nor bent his side.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"And if," continuing his first discourse,
<lb/>"They have that art," he said, "not learned aright,
<lb/>That more tormenteth me, than doth this bed.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But fifty times shall not rekindled be
<lb/>The countenance of the Lady who reigns here,
<lb/>Ere thou shalt know how heavy is that art;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And as thou wouldst to the sweet world return,
<lb/>Say why that people is so pitiless
<lb/>Against my race in each one of its laws?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Whence I to him: "The slaughter and great carnage
<lb/>Which have with crimson stained the Arbia, cause
<lb/>Such orisons in our temple to be made."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>After his head he with a sigh had shaken,
<lb/>"There I was not alone," he said, "nor surely
<lb/>Without a cause had with the others moved.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But there I was alone, where every one
<lb/>Consented to the laying waste of Florence,
<lb/>He who defended her with open face."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Ah! so hereafter may your seed repose,"
<lb/>I him entreated, "solve for me that knot,
<lb/>Which has entangled my conceptions here.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>It seems that you can see, if I hear rightly,
<lb/>Beforehand whatsoe'er time brings with it,
<lb/>And in the present have another mode."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"We see, like those who have imperfect sight,
<lb/>The things," he said, "that distant are from us;
<lb/>So much still shines on us the Sovereign Ruler.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>When they draw near, or are, is wholly vain
<lb/>Our intellect, and if none brings it to us,
<lb/>Not anything know we of your human state.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Hence thou canst understand, that wholly dead
<lb/>Will be our knowledge from the moment when
<lb/>The portal of the future shall be closed."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then I, as if compunctious for my fault,
<lb/>Said: "Now, then, you will tell that fallen one,
<lb/>That still his son is with the living joined.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And if just now, in answering, I was dumb,
<lb/>Tell him I did it because I was thinking
<lb/>Already of the error you have solved me."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And now my Master was recalling me,
<lb/>Wherefore more eagerly I prayed the spirit
<lb/>That he would tell me who was with him there.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>He said: "With more than a thousand here I lie;
<lb/>Within here is the second Frederick,
<lb/>And the Cardinal, and of the rest I speak not."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thereon he hid himself; and I towards
<lb/>The ancient poet turned my steps, reflecting
<lb/>Upon that saying, which seemed hostile to me.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>He moved along; and afterward thus going,
<lb/>He said to me, "Why art thou so bewildered?"
<lb/>And I in his inquiry satisfied him.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Let memory preserve what thou hast heard
<lb/>Against thyself," that Sage commanded me,
<lb/>"And now attend here;" and he raised his finger.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"When thou shalt be before the radiance sweet
<lb/>Of her whose beauteous eyes all things behold,
<lb/>From her thou'lt know the journey of thy life."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Unto the left hand then he turned his feet;
<lb/>We left the wall, and went towards the middle,
<lb/>Along a path that strikes into a valley,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Which even up there unpleasant made its stench.
</stanza>

<canto numeral="XI"/>

<stanza>
<lb/>Upon the margin of a lofty bank
<lb/>Which great rocks broken in a circle made,
<lb/>We came upon a still more cruel throng;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And there, by reason of the horrible
<lb/>Excess of stench the deep abyss throws out,
<lb/>We drew ourselves aside behind the cover
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Of a great tomb, whereon I saw a writing,
<lb/>Which said: "Pope Anastasius I hold,
<lb/>Whom out of the right way Photinus drew."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Slow it behoveth our descent to be,
<lb/>So that the sense be first a little used
<lb/>To the sad blast, and then we shall not heed it."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The Master thus; and unto him I said,
<lb/>"Some compensation find, that the time pass not
<lb/>Idly;" and he: "Thou seest I think of that.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>My son, upon the inside of these rocks,"
<lb/>Began he then to say, "are three small circles,
<lb/>From grade to grade, like those which thou art leaving.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>They all are full of spirits maledict;
<lb/>But that hereafter sight alone suffice thee,
<lb/>Hear how and wherefore they are in constraint.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Of every malice that wins hate in Heaven,
<lb/>Injury is the end; and all such end
<lb/>Either by force or fraud afflicteth others.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But because fraud is man's peculiar vice,
<lb/>More it displeases God; and so stand lowest
<lb/>The fraudulent, and greater dole assails them.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>All the first circle of the Violent is;
<lb/>But since force may be used against three persons,
<lb/>In three rounds 'tis divided and constructed.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>To God, to ourselves, and to our neighbour can we
<lb/>Use force; I say on them and on their things,
<lb/>As thou shalt hear with reason manifest.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>A death by violence, and painful wounds,
<lb/>Are to our neighbour given; and in his substance
<lb/>Ruin, and arson, and injurious levies;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Whence homicides, and he who smites unjustly,
<lb/>Marauders, and freebooters, the first round
<lb/>Tormenteth all in companies diverse.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Man may lay violent hands upon himself
<lb/>And his own goods; and therefore in the second
<lb/>Round must perforce without avail repent
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Whoever of your world deprives himself,
<lb/>Who games, and dissipates his property,
<lb/>And weepeth there, where he should jocund be.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Violence can be done the Deity,
<lb/>In heart denying and blaspheming Him,
<lb/>And by disdaining Nature and her bounty.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And for this reason doth the smallest round
<lb/>Seal with its signet Sodom and Cahors,
<lb/>And who, disdaining God, speaks from the heart.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Fraud, wherewithal is every conscience stung,
<lb/>A man may practise upon him who trusts,
<lb/>And him who doth no confidence imburse.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>This latter mode, it would appear, dissevers
<lb/>Only the bond of love which Nature makes;
<lb/>Wherefore within the second circle nestle
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Hypocrisy, flattery, and who deals in magic,
<lb/>Falsification, theft, and simony,
<lb/>Panders, and barrators, and the like filth.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>By the other mode, forgotten is that love
<lb/>Which Nature makes, and what is after added,
<lb/>From which there is a special faith engendered.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Hence in the smallest circle, where the point is
<lb/>Of the Universe, upon which Dis is seated,
<lb/>Whoe'er betrays for ever is consumed."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And I: "My Master, clear enough proceeds
<lb/>Thy reasoning, and full well distinguishes
<lb/>This cavern and the people who possess it.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But tell me, those within the fat lagoon,
<lb/>Whom the wind drives, and whom the rain doth beat,
<lb/>And who encounter with such bitter tongues,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Wherefore are they inside of the red city
<lb/>Not punished, if God has them in his wrath,
<lb/>And if he has not, wherefore in such fashion?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And unto me he said: "Why wanders so
<lb/>Thine intellect from that which it is wont?
<lb/>Or, sooth, thy mind where is it elsewhere looking?
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Hast thou no recollection of those words
<lb/>With which thine Ethics thoroughly discusses
<lb/>The dispositions three, that Heaven abides not,--
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Incontinence, and Malice, and insane
<lb/>Bestiality? and how Incontinence
<lb/>Less God offendeth, and less blame attracts?
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>If thou regardest this conclusion well,
<lb/>And to thy mind recallest who they are
<lb/>That up outside are undergoing penance,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Clearly wilt thou perceive why from these felons
<lb/>They separated are, and why less wroth
<lb/>Justice divine doth smite them with its hammer."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"O Sun, that healest all distempered vision,
<lb/>Thou dost content me so, when thou resolvest,
<lb/>That doubting pleases me no less than knowing!
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Once more a little backward turn thee," said I,
<lb/>"There where thou sayest that usury offends
<lb/>Goodness divine, and disengage the knot."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Philosophy," he said, "to him who heeds it,
<lb/>Noteth, not only in one place alone,
<lb/>After what manner Nature takes her course
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>From Intellect Divine, and from its art;
<lb/>And if thy Physics carefully thou notest,
<lb/>After not many pages shalt thou find,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>That this your art as far as possible
<lb/>Follows, as the disciple doth the master;
<lb/>So that your art is, as it were, God's grandchild.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>From these two, if thou bringest to thy mind
<lb/>Genesis at the beginning, it behoves
<lb/>Mankind to gain their life and to advance;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And since the usurer takes another way,
<lb/>Nature herself and in her follower
<lb/>Disdains he, for elsewhere he puts his hope.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But follow, now, as I would fain go on,
<lb/>For quivering are the Fishes on the horizon,
<lb/>And the Wain wholly over Caurus lies,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And far beyond there we descend the crag."

<lb/>The place where to descend the bank we came
<lb/>Was alpine, and from what was there, moreover,

<stanza>
<lb/>Such as that ruin is which in the flank
<lb/>Smote, on this side of Trent, the Adige,
<lb/>Either by earthquake or by failing stay,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>For from the mountain's top, from which it moved,
<lb/>Unto the plain the cliff is shattered so,
<lb/>Some path 'twould give to him who was above;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Even such was the descent of that ravine,
<lb/>And on the border of the broken chasm
<lb/>The infamy of Crete was stretched along,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Who was conceived in the fictitious cow;
<lb/>And when he us beheld, he <punishment_phrase>bit himself,</punishment_phrase>
<lb/>Even as one whom anger racks within.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>My Sage towards him shouted: "Peradventure

<lb/>Who in the world above brought death to thee?

<stanza>
<lb/>Get thee gone, beast, for this one cometh not

<lb/>As is that bull who breaks loose at the moment

<stanza>
<lb/>The Minotaur beheld I do the like;
<lb/>And he, the wary, cried: "Run to the passage;
<lb/>While he wroth, 'tis well thou shouldst descend."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thus down we took our way o'er that discharge
<lb/>Of stones, which oftentimes did move themselves
<lb/>Beneath my feet, from the unwonted burden.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thoughtful I went; and he said: "Thou art thinking
<lb/>Perhaps upon this ruin, which is guarded
<lb/>By that brute anger which just now I quenched.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Now will I have thee know, the other time
<lb/>I here descended to the nether Hell,
<lb/>This precipice had not yet fallen down.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But truly, if I well discern, a little
<lb/>Before His coming who the mighty spoil
<lb/>Bore off from Dis, in the supernal circle,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Upon all sides the deep and loathsome valley
<lb/>Trembled so, that I thought the Universe
<lb/>Was thrilled with love, by which there are who think
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The world ofttimes converted into chaos;
<lb/>And at that moment this primeval crag
<lb/>Both here and elsewhere made such overthrow.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But fix thine eyes below; for draweth near
<lb/>The river of blood, within which boiling is
<lb/>Whoe'er by violence doth injure others."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>O blind cupidity, O wrath insane,
<lb/>That spurs us onward so in our short life,
<lb/>And in the eternal then so badly steeps us!
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I saw an ample moat bent like a bow,
<lb/>As one which all the plain encompasses,
<lb/>Conformable to what my Guide had said.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And between this and the embankment's foot
<lb/>Centaurs in file were running, armed with arrows,
<lb/>As in the world they used the chase to follow.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Beholding us descend, each one stood still,
<lb/>And from the squadron three detached themselves,
<lb/>With bows and arrows in advance selected;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And from afar one cried: "Unto what torment
<lb/>Come ye, who down the hillside are descending?
<lb/>Tell us from there; if not, I draw the bow."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>My Master said: "Our answer will we make
<lb/>To Chiron, near you there; in evil hour,
<lb/>That will of thine was evermore so hasty."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then touched he me, and said: "This one is Nessus,
<lb/>Who perished for the lovely Dejanira,
<lb/>And for himself, himself did vengeance take.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And he in the midst, who at his breast is gazing,
<lb/>Is the great Chiron, who brought up Achilles;
<lb/>That other Pholus is, who was so wrathful.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thousands and thousands go about the moat
<lb/><punishment_phrase>Shooting with shafts</punishment_phrase> whatever soul emerges
<lb/>Out of the blood, more than his crime allots."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Near we approached unto those monsters fleet;
<lb/>Chiron an arrow took, and with the notch
<lb/>Backward upon his jaws he put his beard.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>After he had uncovered his great mouth,
<lb/>He said to his companions: "Are you ware
<lb/>That he behind moveth whate'er he touches?
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thus are not wont to do the feet of dead men."
<lb/>And my good Guide, who now was at his breast,
<lb/>Where the two natures are together joined,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Replied: "Indeed he lives, and thus alone
<lb/>Me it behoves to show him the dark valley;
<lb/>Necessity, and not delight, impels us.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Some one withdrew from singing Halleluja,
<lb/>Who unto me committed this new office;
<lb/>No thief is he, nor I a thievish spirit.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But by that virtue through which I am moving
<lb/>My steps along this savage thoroughfare,
<lb/>Give us some one of thine, to be with us,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And who may show us where to pass the ford,
<lb/>And who may carry this one on his back;
<lb/>For 'tis no spirit that can walk the air."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Upon his right breast Chiron wheeled about,
<lb/>And said to Nessus: "Turn and do thou guide them,
<lb/>And warn aside, if other band may meet you."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>We with our faithful escort onward moved
<lb/>Along the brink of the vermilion boiling,
<lb/>Wherein <punishment_phrase>the <torture_word synset="boil.v.02">boiled</torture_word> were uttering loud <pain_word>laments</pain_word>.</punishment_phrase>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>People I saw within up to the eyebrows,
<lb/>And the great Centaur said: "Tyrants are these,
<lb/>Who dealt in bloodshed and in pillaging.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Here they lament their pitiless mischiefs; here
<lb/>Is Alexander, and fierce Dionysius
<lb/>Who upon Sicily brought dolorous years.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>That forehead there which has the hair so black
<lb/>Is Azzolin; and the other who is blond,
<lb/>Obizzo is of Esti, who, in truth,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Up in the world was by his stepson slain."
<lb/>Then turned I to the Poet; and he said,
<lb/>"Now he be first to thee, and second I."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>A little farther on the Centaur stopped
<lb/>Above a folk, <punishment_phrase>who far down as the throat
<lb/>Seemed from that <torture_word synset="boil.v.03">boiled</torture_word> stream to issue forth.</punishment_phrase>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>A shade he showed us on one side alone,
<lb/>Saying: "He cleft asunder in God's bosom
<lb/>The heart that still upon the Thames is honoured."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then people saw I, who from out the river
<lb/>Lifted their heads and also all the chest;
<lb/>And many among these I recognised.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thus ever more and more grew shallower
<lb/>That blood, so that the feet alone it covered;
<lb/>And there across the moat our passage was.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Even as thou here upon this side beholdest
<lb/>The boiling stream, that aye diminishes,"
<lb/>The Centaur said, "I wish thee to believe
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>That on this other more and more declines
<lb/>Its bed, until it reunites itself
<lb/>Where it behoveth tyranny to groan.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Justice divine, upon this side, is goading
<lb/>That Attila, who was a scourge on earth,

<stanza>
<lb/>The tears which with the boiling it unseals
<lb/>In Rinier da Corneto and Rinier Pazzo,

<lb/>And person none beheld I who might make them,
<lb/>Whence, utterly bewildered, I stood still.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I think he thought that I perhaps might think
<lb/>So many voices issued through those trunks
<lb/>From people who concealed themselves from us;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Therefore the Master said: "If thou break off
<lb/>Some little spray from any of these trees,
<lb/>The thoughts thou hast will wholly be made vain."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then stretched I forth my hand a little forward,
<lb/>And plucked a branchlet off from a great thorn;
<lb/>And the trunk cried, "Why dost thou mangle me?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>After it had become embrowned with blood,
<lb/>It recommenced its cry: "Why dost thou rend me?
<lb/>Hast thou no spirit of pity whatsoever?
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Men once we were, and now are <punishment_phrase>changed to trees</punishment_phrase>;
<lb/>Indeed, thy hand should be more pitiful,
<lb/>Even if the souls of serpents we had been."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>As out of a green brand, that is on fire
<lb/>At one of the ends, and from the other drips
<lb/>And hisses with the wind that is escaping;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>So from that splinter issued forth together
<lb/>Both words and blood; whereat I let the tip
<lb/>Fall, and stood like a man who is afraid.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Had he been able sooner to believe,"
<lb/>My Sage made answer, "O thou wounded soul,
<lb/>What only in my verses he has seen,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Not upon thee had he stretched forth his hand;
<lb/>Whereas the thing incredible has caused me
<lb/>To put him to an act which grieveth me.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But tell him who thou wast, so that by way
<lb/>Of some amends thy fame he may refresh
<lb/>Up in the world, to which he can return."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And the trunk said: "So thy sweet words allure me,
<lb/>I cannot silent be; and you be vexed not,
<lb/>That I a little to discourse am tempted.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I am the one who both keys had in keeping
<lb/>Of Frederick's heart, and turned them to and fro
<lb/>So softly in unlocking and in locking,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>That from his secrets most men I withheld;
<lb/>Fidelity I bore the glorious office
<lb/>So great, I lost thereby my sleep and pulses.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The courtesan who never from the dwelling
<lb/>Of Caesar turned aside her strumpet eyes,
<lb/>Death universal and the vice of courts,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Inflamed against me all the other minds,
<lb/>And they, inflamed, did so inflame Augustus,
<lb/>That my glad honours turned to dismal mournings.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>My spirit, in disdainful exultation,
<lb/>Thinking by dying to escape disdain,
<lb/>Made me unjust against myself, the just.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I, by the roots unwonted of this wood,
<lb/>Do swear to you that never broke I faith
<lb/>Unto my lord, who was so worthy of honour;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And to the world if one of you return,
<lb/>Let him my memory comfort, which is lying
<lb/>Still prostrate from the blow that envy dealt it."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Waited awhile, and then: "Since he is silent,"
<lb/>The Poet said to me, "lose not the time,
<lb/>But speak, and question him, if more may please thee."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Whence I to him: "Do thou again inquire
<lb/>Concerning what thou thinks't will satisfy me;
<lb/>For I cannot, such pity is in my heart."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Therefore he recommenced: "So may the man
<lb/>Do for thee freely what thy speech implores,
<lb/>Spirit incarcerate, again be pleased
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>To tell us in what way the soul is bound
<lb/>Within these knots; and tell us, if thou canst,
<lb/>If any from such members e'er is freed."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then blew the trunk amain, and afterward
<lb/>The wind was into such a voice converted:
<lb/>"With brevity shall be replied to you.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>When the exasperated soul abandons
<lb/>The body whence it rent itself away,
<lb/>Minos consigns it to the seventh abyss.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>It falls into the forest, and no part
<lb/>Is chosen for it; but where Fortune hurls it,
<lb/>There like a grain of spelt it germinates.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>It springs a sapling, and a forest tree;
<lb/>The Harpies, <punishment_phrase>feeding then upon its leaves</punishment_phrase>,
<lb/>Do pain create, and for the pain an outlet.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Like others for our spoils shall we return;
<lb/>But not that any one may them revest,
<lb/>For 'tis not just to have what one casts off.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Here we shall drag them, and along the dismal
<lb/>Forest <punishment_phrase>our bodies shall suspended be</punishment_phrase>,
<lb/>Each to the thorn of his molested shade."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>We were attentive still unto the trunk,
<lb/>Thinking that more it yet might wish to tell us,
<lb/>When by a tumult we were overtaken,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>In the same way as he is who perceives
<lb/>The boar and chase approaching to his stand,
<lb/>Who hears the crashing of the beasts and branches;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And two behold! upon our left-hand side,
<lb/>Naked and scratched, fleeing so furiously,
<lb/>That of the forest, every fan they broke.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>He who was in advance: "Now help, Death, help!"
<lb/>And the other one, who seemed to lag too much,
<lb/>Was shouting: "Lano, were not so alert
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Those legs of thine at joustings of the Toppo!"
<lb/>And then, perchance because his breath was failing,
<lb/>He grouped himself together with a bush.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Behind them was the forest full of black
<lb/>She-mastiffs, ravenous, and swift of foot
<lb/>As greyhounds, who are issuing from the chain.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>On him who had crouched down <punishment_phrase>they set their teeth</punishment_phrase>,
<lb/>And him they <punishment_phrase>lacerated piece by piece,</punishment_phrase>
<lb/>Thereafter bore away those aching members.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thereat my Escort took me by the hand,
<lb/>And led me to the bush, that all in vain
<lb/>Was <punishment_phrase><pain_word>weeping</pain_word> from its bloody lacerations.</punishment_phrase>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"O Jacopo," it said, "of Sant' Andrea,
<lb/>What helped it thee of me to make a screen?
<lb/>What blame have I in thy nefarious life?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>When near him had the Master stayed his steps,
<lb/>He said: "Who wast thou, that through wounds so many
<lb/>Art blowing out with blood thy dolorous speech?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And he to us: "O souls, that hither come
<lb/>To look upon the shameful massacre
<lb/>That has so rent away from me my leaves,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Gather them up beneath the dismal bush;
<lb/>I of that city was which to the Baptist
<lb/>Changed its first patron, wherefore he for this
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Forever with his art will make it sad.
<lb/>And were it not that on the pass of Arno
<lb/>Some glimpses of him are remaining still,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Those citizens, who afterwards rebuilt it
<lb/>Upon the ashes left by Attila,
<lb/>In vain had caused their labour to be done.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Of my own house I made myself a gibbet."
</stanza>
    
</pouch_ring>

<canto numeral="XIV"/>
    
<pouch_ring number="3" sub_sin="violent_to_god">

<stanza>
<lb/>Because the charity of my native place
<lb/>Constrained me, gathered I the scattered leaves,
<lb/>And gave them back to him, who now was hoarse.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then came we to the confine, where disparted
<lb/>The second round is from the third, and where
<lb/>A horrible form of Justice is beheld.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Clearly to manifest these novel things,
<lb/>I say that we arrived upon a plain,
<lb/>Which from its bed rejecteth every plant;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The dolorous forest is a garland to it
<lb/>All round about, as the sad moat to that;
<lb/>There close upon the edge we stayed our feet.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The soil was of an arid and thick sand,
<lb/>Not of another fashion made than that
<lb/>Which by the feet of Cato once was pressed.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Vengeance of God, O how much oughtest thou
<lb/>By each one to be dreaded, who doth read
<lb/>That which was manifest unto mine eyes!
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Of naked souls beheld I many herds,
<lb/>Who all were <punishment_phrase><pain_word>weeping</pain_word> very miserably,</punishment_phrase>
<lb/>And over them seemed set a law diverse.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Supine upon the ground some folk were lying;
<lb/>And some were sitting all drawn up together,
<lb/>And others went about continually.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Those who were going round were far the more,
<lb/>And those were less who lay down to their torment,
<lb/>But had their <punishment_phrase>tongues more loosed to <pain_word>lamentation</pain_word></punishment_phrase>.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>O'er all the sand-waste, with a gradual fall,
<lb/>Were <punishment_phrase>raining down dilated flakes of <torture_word synset="fire.n.03">fire</torture_word>,</punishment_phrase>
<lb/>As of the snow on Alp without a wind.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>As Alexander, in those torrid parts
<lb/>Of India, beheld upon his host
<lb/>Flames fall unbroken till they reached the ground.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Whence he provided with his phalanxes
<lb/>To trample down the soil, because the vapour
<lb/>Better extinguished was while it was single;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thus was descending the eternal heat,
<lb/><punishment_phrase>Whereby the sand was set on <torture_word synset="fire.n.01">fire</torture_word></punishment_phrase>, like tinder
<lb/>Beneath the steel, for doubling of the dole.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Without repose forever was the dance
<lb/>Of miserable hands, now there, now here,
<lb/>Shaking away from off them the fresh gleeds.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Master," began I, "thou who overcomest
<lb/>All things except the demons dire, that issued
<lb/>Against us at the entrance of the gate,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Who is that mighty one who seems to heed not
<lb/>The fire, and lieth lowering and disdainful,
<lb/>So that the rain seems not to ripen him?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And he himself, who had become aware
<lb/>That I was questioning my Guide about him,
<lb/>Cried: "Such as I was living, am I, dead.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>If Jove should weary out his smith, from whom
<lb/>He seized in anger the sharp thunderbolt,
<lb/>Wherewith upon the last day I was smitten,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And if he wearied out by turns the others
<lb/>In Mongibello at the swarthy forge,
<lb/>Vociferating, 'Help, good Vulcan, help!'
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Even as he did there at the fight of Phlegra,
<lb/>And shot his bolts at me with all his might,
<lb/>He would not have thereby a joyous vengeance."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then did my Leader speak with such great force,
<lb/>That I had never heard him speak so loud:
<lb/>"O Capaneus, in that is not extinguished
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thine arrogance, thou punished art the more;
<lb/>Not any torment, saving thine own rage,
<lb/>Would be unto thy fury pain complete."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then he turned round to me with better lip,
<lb/>Saying: "One of the Seven Kings was he
<lb/>Who Thebes besieged, and held, and seems to hold
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>God in disdain, and little seems to prize him;
<lb/>But, as I said to him, his own despites
<lb/>Are for his breast the fittest ornaments.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Now follow me, and mind thou do not place
<lb/>As yet thy feet upon the burning sand,
<lb/>But always keep them close unto the wood."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Speaking no word, we came to where there gushes
<lb/>Forth from the wood a little rivulet,
<lb/>Whose redness makes my hair still stand on end.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>As from the Bulicame springs the brooklet,
<lb/>The sinful women later share among them,
<lb/>So downward through the sand it went its way.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The bottom of it, and both sloping banks,
<lb/>Were made of stone, and the margins at the side;
<lb/>Whence I perceived that there the passage was.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"In all the rest which I have shown to thee
<lb/>Since we have entered in within the gate
<lb/>Whose threshold unto no one is denied,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Nothing has been discovered by thine eyes
<lb/>So notable as is the present river,
<lb/>Which all the little flames above it quenches."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>These words were of my Leader; whence I prayed him
<lb/>That he would give me largess of the food,
<lb/>For which he had given me largess of desire.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"In the mid-sea there sits a wasted land,"
<lb/>Said he thereafterward, "whose name is Crete,
<lb/>Under whose king the world of old was chaste.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>There is a mountain there, that once was glad
<lb/>With waters and with leaves, which was called Ida;
<lb/>Now 'tis deserted, as a thing worn out.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Rhea once chose it for the faithful cradle
<lb/>Of her own son; and to conceal him better,
<lb/>Whene'er he cried, she there had clamours made.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>A grand old man stands in the mount erect,
<lb/>Who holds his shoulders turned tow'rds Damietta,
<lb/>And looks at Rome as if it were his mirror.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>His head is fashioned of refined gold,
<lb/>And of pure silver are the arms and breast;
<lb/>Then he is brass as far down as the fork.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>From that point downward all is chosen iron,
<lb/>Save that the right foot is of kiln-baked clay,
<lb/>And more he stands on that than on the other.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Each part, except the gold, is by a fissure
<lb/>Asunder cleft, that dripping is with tears,
<lb/>Which gathered together perforate that cavern.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>From rock to rock they fall into this valley;
<lb/>Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon they form;
<lb/>Then downward go along this narrow sluice
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Unto that point where is no more descending.
<lb/>They form Cocytus; what that pool may be
<lb/>Thou shalt behold, so here 'tis not narrated."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And I to him: "If so the present runnel
<lb/>Doth take its rise in this way from our world,
<lb/>Why only on this verge appears it to us?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And he to me: "Thou knowest the place is round,
<lb/>And notwithstanding thou hast journeyed far,
<lb/>Still to the left descending to the bottom,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thou hast not yet through all the circle turned.
<lb/>Therefore if something new appear to us,
<lb/>It should not bring amazement to thy face."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And I again: "Master, where shall be found
<lb/>Lethe and Phlegethon, for of one thou'rt silent,
<lb/>And sayest the other of this rain is made?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"In all thy questions truly thou dost please me,"
<lb/>Replied he; "but the boiling of the red
<lb/>Water might well solve one of them thou makest.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thou shalt see Lethe, but outside this moat,
<lb/>There where the souls repair to lave themselves,
<lb/>When sin repented of has been removed."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then said he: "It is time now to abandon
<lb/>The wood; take heed that thou come after me;
<lb/>A way the margins make that are not burning,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And over them all vapours are extinguished."
</stanza>

<canto numeral="XV"/>

<stanza>
<lb/>Now bears us onward one of the hard margins,
<lb/>And so the brooklet's mist o'ershadows it,
<lb/>From fire it saves the water and the dikes.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Even as the Flemings, 'twixt Cadsand and Bruges,
<lb/><punishment_phrase>Fearing the flood that tow'rds them hurls itself,</punishment_phrase>
<lb/>Their bulwarks build to put the sea to flight;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And as the Paduans along the Brenta,
<lb/>To guard their villas and their villages,
<lb/>Or ever Chiarentana feel the heat;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>In such similitude had those been made,
<lb/>Albeit not so lofty nor so thick,
<lb/>Whoever he might be, the master made them.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Now were we from the forest so remote,
<lb/>I could not have discovered where it was,
<lb/>Even if backward I had turned myself,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>When we a company of souls encountered,
<lb/>Who came beside the dike, and every one
<lb/>Gazed at us, as at evening we are wont
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>To eye each other under a new moon,
<lb/>And so towards us sharpened they their brows
<lb/>As an old tailor at the needle's eye.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thus scrutinised by such a family,
<lb/>By some one I was recognised, who seized
<lb/>My garment's hem, and cried out, "What a marvel!"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And I, when he stretched forth his arm to me,
<lb/>On his baked aspect fastened so mine eyes,
<lb/>That the scorched countenance prevented not
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>His recognition by my intellect;
<lb/>And bowing down my face unto his own,
<lb/>I made reply, "Are you here, Ser Brunetto?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And he: "May't not displease thee, O my son,
<lb/>If a brief space with thee Brunetto Latini
<lb/>Backward return and let the trail go on."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I said to him: "With all my power I ask it;
<lb/>And if you wish me to sit down with you,
<lb/>I will, if he please, for I go with him."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"O son," he said, "whoever of this herd
<lb/><punishment_phrase>A moment stops, lies then a hundred years,</punishment_phrase>
<lb/>Nor fans himself when smiteth him the fire.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Therefore go on; I at thy skirts will come,
<lb/>And afterward will I rejoin my band,
<lb/>Which goes lamenting its eternal doom."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I did not dare to go down from the road
<lb/>Level to walk with him; but my head bowed
<lb/>I held as one who goeth reverently.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And he began: "What fortune or what fate
<lb/>Before the last day leadeth thee down here?
<lb/>And who is this that showeth thee the way?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Up there above us in the life serene,"
<lb/>I answered him, "I lost me in a valley,
<lb/>Or ever yet my age had been completed.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But yestermorn I turned my back upon it;
<lb/>This one appeared to me, returning thither,
<lb/>And homeward leadeth me along this road."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And he to me: "If thou thy star do follow,
<lb/>Thou canst not fail thee of a glorious port,
<lb/>If well I judged in the life beautiful.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And if I had not died so prematurely,
<lb/>Seeing Heaven thus benignant unto thee,
<lb/>I would have given thee comfort in the work.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But that ungrateful and malignant people,
<lb/>Which of old time from Fesole descended,
<lb/>And smacks still of the mountain and the granite,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Will make itself, for thy good deeds, thy foe;
<lb/>And it is right; for among crabbed sorbs
<lb/>It ill befits the sweet fig to bear fruit.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Old rumour in the world proclaims them blind;
<lb/>A people avaricious, envious, proud;
<lb/>Take heed that of their customs thou do cleanse thee.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thy fortune so much honour doth reserve thee,
<lb/>One party and the other shall be hungry
<lb/>For thee; but far from goat shall be the grass.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Their litter let the beasts of Fesole
<lb/>Make of themselves, nor let them touch the plant,
<lb/>If any still upon their dunghill rise,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>In which may yet revive the consecrated
<lb/>Seed of those Romans, who remained there when
<lb/>The nest of such great malice it became."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"If my entreaty wholly were fulfilled,"
<lb/>Replied I to him, "not yet would you be
<lb/>In banishment from human nature placed;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>For in my mind is fixed, and touches now
<lb/>My heart the dear and good paternal image
<lb/>Of you, when in the world from hour to hour
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>You taught me how a man becomes eternal;
<lb/>And how much I am grateful, while I live
<lb/>Behoves that in my language be discerned.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>What you narrate of my career I write,
<lb/>And keep it to be glossed with other text
<lb/>By a Lady who can do it, if I reach her.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>This much will I have manifest to you;
<lb/>Provided that my conscience do not chide me,
<lb/>For whatsoever Fortune I am ready.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Such handsel is not new unto mine ears;
<lb/>Therefore let Fortune turn her wheel around
<lb/>As it may please her, and the churl his mattock."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>My Master thereupon on his right cheek
<lb/>Did backward turn himself, and looked at me;
<lb/>Then said: "He listeneth well who noteth it."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Nor speaking less on that account, I go
<lb/>With Ser Brunetto, and I ask who are
<lb/>His most known and most eminent companions.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And he to me: "To know of some is well;
<lb/>Of others it were laudable to be silent,
<lb/>For short would be the time for so much speech.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Know them in sum, that all of them were clerks,
<lb/>And men of letters great and of great fame,
<lb/>In the world tainted with the selfsame sin.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Priscian goes yonder with that wretched crowd,
<lb/>And Francis of Accorso; and thou hadst seen there
<lb/>If thou hadst had a hankering for such scurf,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>That one, who by the Servant of the Servants
<lb/>From Arno was transferred to Bacchiglione,
<lb/>Where he has left his sin-excited nerves.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>More would I say, but coming and discoursing
<lb/>Can be no longer; for that I behold
<lb/>New smoke uprising yonder from the sand.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>A people comes with whom I may not be;
<lb/>Commended unto thee be my Tesoro,
<lb/>In which I still live, and no more I ask."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then he turned round, and seemed to be of those
<lb/>Who at Verona run for the Green Mantle
<lb/>Across the plain; and seemed to be among them
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The one who wins, and not the one who loses.
</stanza>
    
<canto numeral="XVI"/>
        
<stanza>
<lb/>Now was I where was heard the reverberation
<lb/>Of water falling into the next round,
<lb/>Like to that humming which the beehives make,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>When shadows three together started forth,
<lb/>Running, from out a company that passed
<lb/>Beneath the rain of the sharp martyrdom.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Towards us came they, and each one cried out:
<lb/>"Stop, thou; for by thy garb to us thou seemest
<lb/>To be some one of our depraved city."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Ah me! what <punishment_phrase><pain_word>wounds</pain_word> I saw upon their limbs,</punishment_phrase>
<lb/>Recent and ancient by the <punishment_phrase><torture_word synset="flame.v.02">flames</torture_word> burnt in!</punishment_phrase>
<lb/>It pains me still but to remember it.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Unto their cries my Teacher paused attentive;
<lb/>He turned his face towards me, and "Now wait,"
<lb/>He said; "to these we should be courteous.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And if it were not for the fire that darts
<lb/>The nature of this region, I should say
<lb/>That haste were more becoming thee than them."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>As soon as we stood still, they recommenced
<lb/>The old refrain, and when they overtook us,
<lb/>Formed of themselves a wheel, all three of them.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>As champions stripped and oiled are wont to do,
<lb/>Watching for their advantage and their hold,
<lb/>Before they come to blows and thrusts between them,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thus, wheeling round, did every one his visage
<lb/>Direct to me, so that in opposite wise
<lb/>His neck and feet continual journey made.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And, "If the misery of this soft place
<lb/>Bring in disdain ourselves and our entreaties,"
<lb/>Began one, "and our aspect black and blistered,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Let the renown of us thy mind incline
<lb/>To tell us who thou art, who thus securely
<lb/>Thy living feet dost move along through Hell.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>He in whose footprints thou dost see me treading,
<lb/>Naked and skinless though he now may go,
<lb/>Was of a greater rank than thou dost think;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>He was the grandson of the good Gualdrada;
<lb/>His name was Guidoguerra, and in life
<lb/>Much did he with his wisdom and his sword.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The other, who close by me treads the sand,
<lb/>Tegghiaio Aldobrandi is, whose fame
<lb/>Above there in the world should welcome be.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And I, who with them on the cross am placed,
<lb/>Jacopo Rusticucci was; and truly
<lb/>My savage wife, more than aught else, doth harm me."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Could I have been protected from the fire,
<lb/>Below I should have thrown myself among them,
<lb/>And think the Teacher would have suffered it;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But as I should have burned and baked myself,
<lb/>My terror overmastered my good will,
<lb/>Which made me greedy of embracing them.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then I began: "Sorrow and not disdain
<lb/>Did your condition fix within me so,
<lb/>That tardily it wholly is stripped off,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>As soon as this my Lord said unto me
<lb/>Words, on account of which I thought within me
<lb/>That people such as you are were approaching.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I of your city am; and evermore
<lb/>Your labours and your honourable names
<lb/>I with affection have retraced and heard.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I leave the gall, and go for the sweet fruits
<lb/>Promised to me by the veracious Leader;
<lb/>But to the centre first I needs must plunge."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"So may the soul for a long while conduct
<lb/>Those limbs of thine," did he make answer then,
<lb/>"And so may thy renown shine after thee,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Valour and courtesy, say if they dwell
<lb/>Within our city, as they used to do,
<lb/>Or if they wholly have gone out of it;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>For Guglielmo Borsier, who is in torment
<lb/>With us of late, and goes there with his comrades,
<lb/>Doth greatly mortify us with his words."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"The new inhabitants and the sudden gains,
<lb/>Pride and extravagance have in thee engendered,
<lb/>Florence, so that thou weep'st thereat already!"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>In this wise I exclaimed with face uplifted;
<lb/>And the three, taking that for my reply,
<lb/>Looked at each other, as one looks at truth.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"If other times so little it doth cost thee,"
<lb/>Replied they all, "to satisfy another,
<lb/>Happy art thou, thus speaking at thy will!
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Therefore, if thou escape from these dark places,
<lb/>And come to rebehold the beauteous stars,
<lb/>When it shall pleasure thee to say, 'I was,'
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>See that thou speak of us unto the people."
<lb/>Then they broke up the wheel, and in their flight
<lb/>It seemed as if their agile legs were wings.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Not an Amen could possibly be said
<lb/>So rapidly as they had disappeared;
<lb/>Wherefore the Master deemed best to depart.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I followed him, and little had we gone,
<lb/>Before the sound of water was so near us,
<lb/>That speaking we should hardly have been heard.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Even as that stream which holdeth its own course
<lb/>The first from Monte Veso tow'rds the East,
<lb/>Upon the left-hand slope of Apennine,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Which is above called Acquacheta, ere
<lb/>It down descendeth into its low bed,
<lb/>And at Forli is vacant of that name,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Reverberates there above San Benedetto
<lb/>From Alps, by falling at a single leap,
<lb/>Where for a thousand there were room enough;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thus downward from a bank precipitate,
<lb/>We found resounding that dark-tinted water,
<lb/>So that it soon the ear would have offended.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I had a cord around about me girt,
<lb/>And therewithal I whilom had designed
<lb/>To take the panther with the painted skin.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>After I this had all from me unloosed,
<lb/>As my Conductor had commanded me,
<lb/>I reached it to him, gathered up and coiled,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Whereat he turned himself to the right side,
<lb/>And at a little distance from the verge,
<lb/>He cast it down into that deep abyss.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"It must needs be some novelty respond,"
<lb/>I said within myself, "to the new signal
<lb/>The Master with his eye is following so."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Ah me! how very cautious men should be
<lb/>With those who not alone behold the act,
<lb/>But with their wisdom look into the thoughts!
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>He said to me: "Soon there will upward come
<lb/>What I await; and what thy thought is dreaming
<lb/>Must soon reveal itself unto thy sight."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Aye to that truth which has the face of falsehood,
<lb/>A man should close his lips as far as may be,
<lb/>Because without his fault it causes shame;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But here I cannot; and, Reader, by the notes
<lb/>Of this my Comedy to thee I swear,
<lb/>So may they not be void of lasting favour,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Athwart that dense and darksome atmosphere
<lb/>I saw a figure swimming upward come,
<lb/>Marvellous unto every steadfast heart,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Even as he returns who goeth down
<lb/>Sometimes to clear an anchor, which has grappled
<lb/>Reef, or aught else that in the sea is hidden,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Who upward stretches, and draws in his feet.
</stanza>
    
<canto numeral="XVII"/>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Behold the monster with the pointed tail,
<lb/>Who cleaves the hills, and breaketh walls and weapons,
<lb/>Behold him who infecteth all the world."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thus unto me my Guide began to say,
<lb/>And beckoned him that he should come to shore,
<lb/>Near to the confine of the trodden marble;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And that uncleanly image of deceit
<lb/>Came up and thrust ashore its head and bust,
<lb/>But on the border did not drag its tail.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The face was as the face of a just man,
<lb/>Its semblance outwardly was so benign,
<lb/>And of a serpent all the trunk beside.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Two paws it had, hairy unto the armpits;
<lb/>The back, and breast, and both the sides it had
<lb/>Depicted o'er with nooses and with shields.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>With colours more, groundwork or broidery
<lb/>Never in cloth did Tartars make nor Turks,
<lb/>Nor were such tissues by Arachne laid.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>As sometimes wherries lie upon the shore,
<lb/>That part are in the water, part on land;
<lb/>And as among the guzzling Germans there,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The beaver plants himself to wage his war;
<lb/>So that vile monster lay upon the border,
<lb/>Which is of stone, and shutteth in the sand.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>His tail was wholly quivering in the void,
<lb/>Contorting upwards the envenomed fork,
<lb/>That in the guise of scorpion armed its point.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The Guide said: "Now perforce must turn aside
<lb/>Our way a little, even to that beast
<lb/>Malevolent, that yonder coucheth him."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>We therefore on the right side descended,
<lb/>And made ten steps upon the outer verge,
<lb/>Completely to avoid the sand and flame;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And after we are come to him, I see
<lb/>A little farther off upon the sand
<lb/>A people sitting near the hollow place.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then said to me the Master: "So that full
<lb/>Experience of this round thou bear away,
<lb/>Now go and see what their condition is.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>There let thy conversation be concise;
<lb/>Till thou returnest I will speak with him,
<lb/>That he concede to us his stalwart shoulders."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thus farther still upon the outermost
<lb/>Head of that seventh circle all alone
<lb/>I went, where sat the melancholy folk.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Out of their eyes was gushing forth their woe;
<lb/>This way, that way, they helped them with their hands
<lb/>Now from the flames and now from the hot soil.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Not otherwise in summer do the dogs,
<lb/>Now with the foot, now with the muzzle, when
<lb/><punishment_phrase>By fleas, or flies, or gadflies, they are bitten.</punishment_phrase>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>When I had turned mine eyes upon the faces
<lb/>Of some, <punishment_phrase>on whom the dolorous <torture_word synset="fire.n.01">fire</torture_word> is falling,</punishment_phrase>
<lb/>Not one of them I knew; but I perceived
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>That from the neck of each there hung a pouch,
<lb/>Which certain colour had, and certain blazon;
<lb/>And thereupon it seems their eyes are feeding.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And as I gazing round me come among them,
<lb/>Upon a yellow pouch I azure saw
<lb/>That had the face and posture of a lion.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Proceeding then the current of my sight,
<lb/>Another of them saw I, red as blood,
<lb/>Display a goose more white than butter is.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And one, who with an azure sow and gravid
<lb/>Emblazoned had his little pouch of white,
<lb/>Said unto me: "What dost thou in this moat?
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Now get thee gone; and since thou'rt still alive,
<lb/>Know that a neighbour of mine, Vitaliano,
<lb/>Will have his seat here on my left-hand side.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>A Paduan am I with these Florentines;
<lb/>Full many a time they thunder in mine ears,
<lb/>Exclaiming, 'Come the sovereign cavalier,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>He who shall bring the satchel with three goats;'"
<lb/>Then twisted he his mouth, and forth he thrust
<lb/>His tongue, like to an ox that licks its nose.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And fearing lest my longer stay might vex
<lb/>Him who had warned me not to tarry long,
<lb/>Backward I turned me from those weary souls.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I found my Guide, who had already mounted
<lb/>Upon the back of that wild animal,
<lb/>And said to me: "Now be both strong and bold.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Now we descend by stairways such as these;
<lb/>Mount thou in front, for I will be midway,
<lb/>So that the tail may have no power to harm thee."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Such as he is who has so near the ague
<lb/>Of quartan that his nails are blue already,
<lb/>And trembles all, but looking at the shade;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Even such became I at those proffered words;
<lb/>But shame in me his menaces produced,
<lb/>Which maketh servant strong before good master.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I seated me upon those monstrous shoulders;
<lb/>I wished to say, and yet the voice came not
<lb/>As I believed, "Take heed that thou embrace me."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But he, who other times had rescued me
<lb/>In other peril, soon as I had mounted,
<lb/>Within his arms encircled and sustained me,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And said: "Now, Geryon, bestir thyself;
<lb/>The circles large, and the descent be little;
<lb/>Think of the novel burden which thou hast."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Even as the little vessel shoves from shore,
<lb/>Backward, still backward, so he thence withdrew;
<lb/>And when he wholly felt himself afloat,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>There where his breast had been he turned his tail,
<lb/>And that extended like an eel he moved,
<lb/>And with his paws drew to himself the air.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>A greater fear I do not think there was
<lb/>What time abandoned Phaeton the reins,
<lb/>Whereby the heavens, as still appears, were scorched;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Nor when the wretched Icarus his flanks
<lb/>Felt stripped of feathers by the melting wax,
<lb/>His father crying, "An ill way thou takest!"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Than was my own, when I perceived myself
<lb/>On all sides in the air, and saw extinguished
<lb/>The sight of everything but of the monster.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Onward he goeth, swimming slowly, slowly;
<lb/>Wheels and descends, but I perceive it only
<lb/>By wind upon my face and from below.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I heard already on the right the whirlpool
<lb/>Making a horrible crashing under us;
<lb/>Whence I thrust out my head with eyes cast downward.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then was I still more fearful of the abyss;
<lb/>Because I fires beheld, and heard laments,
<lb/>Whereat I, trembling, all the closer cling.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I saw then, for before I had not seen it,
<lb/>The turning and descending, by great horrors
<lb/>That were approaching upon divers sides.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>As falcon who has long been on the wing,
<lb/>Who, without seeing either lure or bird,
<lb/>Maketh the falconer say, "Ah me, thou stoopest,"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Descendeth weary, whence he started swiftly,
<lb/>Thorough a hundred circles, and alights
<lb/>Far from his master, sullen and disdainful;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Even thus did Geryon place us on the bottom,
<lb/>Close to the bases of the rough-hewn rock,
<lb/>And being disencumbered of our persons,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>He sped away as arrow from the string.

<lb/>There is a place in Hell called Malebolge,

<lb/>Right in the middle of the field malign
<lb/>There yawns a well exceeding wide and deep,

<stanza>
<lb/>Round, then, is that enclosure which remains

</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Ah me! how they did make them lift their legs

</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>While I was going on, mine eyes by one
<lb/>Encountered were; and straight I said: "Already
<lb/>With sight of this one I am not unfed."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Therefore I stayed my feet to make him out,
<lb/>And with me the sweet Guide came to a stand,
<lb/>And to my going somewhat back assented;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And he, the scourged one, thought to hide himself,
<lb/>Lowering his face, but little it availed him;
<lb/>For said I: "Thou that castest down thine eyes,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>If false are not the features which thou bearest,
<lb/>Thou art Venedico Caccianimico;
<lb/>But what doth bring thee to such pungent sauces?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And he to me: "Unwillingly I tell it;
<lb/>But forces me thine utterance distinct,
<lb/>Which makes me recollect the ancient world.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I was the one who the fair Ghisola
<lb/>Induced to grant the wishes of the Marquis,
<lb/>Howe'er the shameless story may be told.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Not the sole Bolognese am I who weeps here;
<lb/>Nay, rather is this place so full of them,

<lb/>'Twixt Reno and Savena to say 'sipa;'
<lb/>And if thereof thou wishest pledge or proof,

</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>While speaking in this manner, with his scourge
<lb/>A demon smote him, and said: "Get thee gone
<lb/>Pander, there are no women here for coin."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I joined myself again unto mine Escort;
<lb/>Thereafterward with footsteps few we came
<lb/>To where a crag projected from the bank.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>This very easily did we ascend,
<lb/>And turning to the right along its ridge,
<lb/>From those eternal circles we departed.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>When we were there, where it is hollowed out
<lb/>Beneath, to give a passage to the scourged,
<lb/>The Guide said: "Wait, and see that on thee strike
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The vision of those others evil-born,
<lb/>Of whom thou hast not yet beheld the faces,
<lb/>Because together with us they have gone."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>From the old bridge we looked upon the train
<lb/>Which tow'rds us came upon the other border,
<lb/>And which the scourges in like manner smite.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And the good Master, without my inquiring,
<lb/>Said to me: "See that tall one who is coming,
<lb/>And for his pain seems not to shed a tear;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Still what a royal aspect he retains!
<lb/>That Jason is, who by his heart and cunning
<lb/>The Colchians of the Ram made destitute.

<stanza>
<lb/>He by the isle of Lemnos passed along
<lb/>After the daring women pitiless
<lb/>Had unto death devoted all their males.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>There with his tokens and with ornate words
<lb/>Did he deceive Hypsipyle, the maiden
<lb/>Who first, herself, had all the rest deceived.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>There did he leave her pregnant and forlorn;
<lb/>Such sin unto such punishment condemns him,
<lb/>And also for Medea is vengeance done.

<stanza>
<lb/>With him go those who in such wise deceive;
<lb/>And this sufficient be of the first valley

<lb/>By exhalation from below, that sticks there,

<stanza>
<lb/>The bottom is so deep, no place suffices
<lb/>To give us sight of it, without ascending

<stanza>
<lb/>Thither we came, and thence down in the moat

<stanza>
<lb/>He screamed to me: "Wherefore art thou so eager

</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then said to me the Guide: "See that thou thrust

<lb/>Recalls him, so that death may be delayed.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And he cried out: "Dost thou stand there already,
<lb/>Dost thou stand there already, Boniface?
<lb/>By many years the record lied to me.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Art thou so early satiate with that wealth,
<lb/>For which thou didst not fear to take by fraud
<lb/>The beautiful Lady, and then work her woe?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Such I became, as people are who stand,
<lb/>Not comprehending what is answered them,
<lb/>As if bemocked, and know not how to answer.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then said Virgilius: "Say to him straightway,
<lb/>'I am not he, I am not he thou thinkest.'"
<lb/>And I replied as was imposed on me.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Whereat the spirit writhed with both his feet,
<lb/>Then, sighing, with a voice of lamentation
<lb/>Said to me: "Then what wantest thou of me?
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>If who I am thou carest so much to know,
<lb/>That thou on that account hast crossed the bank,
<lb/>Know that I vested was with the great mantle;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And truly was I son of the She-bear,
<lb/>So eager to advance the cubs, that wealth
<lb/>Above, and here myself, I pocketed.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Beneath my head the others are dragged down
<lb/>Who have preceded me in simony,
<lb/>Flattened along the fissure of the rock.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Below there I shall likewise fall, whenever
<lb/>That one shall come who I believed thou wast,
<lb/>What time the sudden question I proposed.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But longer I my feet already toast,
<lb/>And here have been in this way upside down,
<lb/>Than he will planted stay with reddened feet;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>For after him shall come of fouler deed
<lb/>From tow'rds the west a Pastor without law,
<lb/>Such as befits to cover him and me.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>New Jason will he be, of whom we read
<lb/>In Maccabees; and as his king was pliant,
<lb/>So he who governs France shall be to this one."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I do not know if I were here too bold,
<lb/>That him I answered only in this metre:
<lb/>"I pray thee tell me now how great a treasure
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Our Lord demanded of Saint Peter first,
<lb/>Before he put the keys into his keeping?
<lb/>Truly he nothing asked but 'Follow me.'
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Nor Peter nor the rest asked of Matthias
<lb/>Silver or gold, when he by lot was chosen
<lb/>Unto the place the guilty soul had lost.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Therefore stay here, for thou art justly punished,
<lb/>And keep safe guard o'er the ill-gotten money,
<lb/>Which caused thee to be valiant against Charles.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And were it not that still forbids it me
<lb/>The reverence for the keys superlative
<lb/>Thou hadst in keeping in the gladsome life,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I would make use of words more grievous still;
<lb/>Because your avarice afflicts the world,
<lb/>Trampling the good and lifting the depraved.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The Evangelist you Pastors had in mind,
<lb/>When she who sitteth upon many waters
<lb/>To fornicate with kings by him was seen;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The same who with the seven heads was born,
<lb/>And power and strength from the ten horns received,
<lb/>So long as virtue to her spouse was pleasing.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Ye have made yourselves a god of gold and silver;
<lb/>And from the idolater how differ ye,
<lb/>Save that he one, and ye a hundred worship?
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Ah, Constantine! of how much ill was mother,
<lb/>Not thy conversion, but that marriage dower
<lb/>Which the first wealthy Father took from thee!"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And while I sang to him such notes as these,
<lb/>Either that anger or that conscience stung him,
<lb/>He struggled violently with both his feet.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I think in sooth that it my Leader pleased,
<lb/>With such contented lip he listened ever
<lb/>Unto the sound of the true words expressed.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Therefore with both his arms he took me up,
<lb/>And when he had me all upon his breast,
<lb/>Remounted by the way where he descended.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Nor did he tire to have me clasped to him;
<lb/>But bore me to the summit of the arch
<lb/>Which from the fourth dike to the fifth is passage.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>There tenderly he laid his burden down,
<lb/>Tenderly on the crag uneven and steep,
<lb/>That would have been hard passage for the goats:
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thence was unveiled to me another valley.

</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I was already thoroughly disposed

<lb/>Which bathed itself with tears of agony;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And people saw I through the circular valley,

<stanza>
<lb/>As lower down my sight descended on them,

<lb/><punishment_phrase>For tow'rds the reins the countenance was turned,

<lb/>How I could ever keep my face unmoistened,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>When our own image near me I beheld
</stanza>
<punishment_phrase><lb/>Distorted so, the <pain_word>weeping</pain_word> of the eyes
<lb/>Along the fissure bathed the hinder parts.</punishment_phrase>

<stanza>
<lb/>Truly I wept, leaning upon a peak
<lb/>Of the hard crag, so that my Escort said
<lb/>To me: "Art thou, too, of the other fools?
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Here pity lives when it is wholly dead;
<lb/>Who is a greater reprobate than he
<lb/>Who feels compassion at the doom divine?
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Lift up, lift up thy head, and see for whom
<lb/>Opened the earth before the Thebans' eyes;
<lb/>Wherefore they all cried: 'Whither rushest thou,

<stanza>
<lb/>Amphiaraus?  Why dost leave the war?'
<lb/>And downward ceased he not to fall amain
<lb/>As far as Minos, who lays hold on all.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>See, he has made a bosom of his shoulders!
<lb/>Because he wished to see too far before him
<lb/>Behind he looks, and backward goes his way:
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Behold Tiresias, who his semblance changed,
<lb/>When from a male a female he became,
<lb/>His members being all of them transformed;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And afterwards was forced to strike once more
<lb/>The two entangled serpents with his rod,
<lb/>Ere he could have again his manly plumes.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>That Aruns is, who backs the other's belly,
<lb/>Who in the hills of Luni, there where grubs
<lb/>The Carrarese who houses underneath,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Among the marbles white a cavern had
<lb/>For his abode; whence to behold the stars
<lb/>And sea, the view was not cut off from him.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And she there, who is covering up her breasts,
<lb/>Which thou beholdest not, with loosened tresses,
<lb/>And on that side has all the hairy skin,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Was Manto, who made quest through many lands,
<lb/>Afterwards tarried there where I was born;
<lb/>Whereof I would thou list to me a little.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>After her father had from life departed,
<lb/>And the city of Bacchus had become enslaved,
<lb/>She a long season wandered through the world.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Above in beauteous Italy lies a lake
<lb/>At the Alp's foot that shuts in Germany
<lb/>Over Tyrol, and has the name Benaco.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>By a thousand springs, I think, and more, is bathed,
<lb/>'Twixt Garda and Val Camonica, Pennino,
<lb/>With water that grows stagnant in that lake.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Midway a place is where the Trentine Pastor,
<lb/>And he of Brescia, and the Veronese
<lb/>Might give his blessing, if he passed that way.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Sitteth Peschiera, fortress fair and strong,
<lb/>To front the Brescians and the Bergamasks,
<lb/>Where round about the bank descendeth lowest.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>There of necessity must fall whatever
<lb/>In bosom of Benaco cannot stay,
<lb/>And grows a river down through verdant pastures.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Soon as the water doth begin to run,
<lb/>No more Benaco is it called, but Mincio,
<lb/>Far as Governo, where it falls in Po.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Not far it runs before it finds a plain
<lb/>In which it spreads itself, and makes it marshy,
<lb/>And oft 'tis wont in summer to be sickly.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Passing that way the virgin pitiless
<lb/>Land in the middle of the fen descried,
<lb/>Untilled and naked of inhabitants;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>There to escape all human intercourse,
<lb/>She with her servants stayed, her arts to practise
<lb/>And lived, and left her empty body there.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The men, thereafter, who were scattered round,
<lb/>Collected in that place, which was made strong
<lb/>By the lagoon it had on every side;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>They built their city over those dead bones,
<lb/>And, after her who first the place selected,
<lb/>Mantua named it, without other omen.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Its people once within more crowded were,
<lb/>Ere the stupidity of Casalodi
<lb/>From Pinamonte had received deceit.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Therefore I caution thee, if e'er thou hearest
<lb/>Originate my city otherwise,
<lb/>No falsehood may the verity defraud."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And I: "My Master, thy discourses are
<lb/>To me so certain, and so take my faith,
<lb/>That unto me the rest would be spent coals.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But tell me of the people who are passing,
<lb/>If any one note-worthy thou beholdest,
<lb/>For only unto that my mind reverts."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then said he to me: "He who from the cheek
<lb/>Thrusts out his beard upon his swarthy shoulders
<lb/>Was, at the time when Greece was void of males,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>So that there scarce remained one in the cradle,
<lb/>An augur, and with Calchas gave the moment,
<lb/>In Aulis, when to sever the first cable.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Eryphylus his name was, and so sings
<lb/>My lofty Tragedy in some part or other;
<lb/>That knowest thou well, who knowest the whole of it.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The next, who is so slender in the flanks,
<lb/>Was Michael Scott, who of a verity
<lb/>Of magical illusions knew the game.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Behold Guido Bonatti, behold Asdente,
<lb/>Who now unto his leather and his thread
<lb/>Would fain have stuck, but he too late repents.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Behold the wretched ones, who left the needle,
<lb/>The spool and rock, and made them fortune-tellers;
<lb/>They wrought their magic spells with herb and image.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But come now, for already holds the confines
<lb/>Of both the hemispheres, and under Seville
<lb/>Touches the ocean-wave, Cain and the thorns,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And yesternight the moon was round already;
<lb/>Thou shouldst remember well it did not harm thee
<lb/>From time to time within the forest deep."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thus spake he to me, and we walked the while.

<canto numeral="XXI"/>

<pouch_ring number="5" sub_sin="barrator">

<stanza>
<lb/>From bridge to bridge thus, speaking other things
<lb/>Of which my Comedy cares not to sing,
<lb/>We came along, and held the summit, when
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>We halted to behold another fissure
<lb/>Of Malebolge and other vain laments;
<lb/>And I beheld it marvellously dark.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>As in the Arsenal of the Venetians
<lb/>Boils in the winter the tenacious pitch
<lb/>To smear their unsound vessels o'er again,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>For sail they cannot; and instead thereof
<lb/>One makes his vessel new, and one recaulks
<lb/>The ribs of that which many a voyage has made;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>One hammers at the prow, one at the stern,
<lb/>This one makes oars, and that one cordage twists,
<lb/>Another mends the mainsail and the mizzen;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thus, not by fire, but by the art divine,
<lb/>Was boiling down below there a dense pitch
<lb/>Which upon every side the bank belimed.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I saw it, but I did not see within it
<lb/>Aught but the bubbles that the boiling raised,
<lb/>And all swell up and resubside compressed.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The while below there fixedly I gazed,
<lb/>My Leader, crying out: "Beware, beware!"
<lb/>Drew me unto himself from where I stood.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then I turned round, as one who is impatient
<lb/>To see what it behoves him to escape,
<lb/>And whom a sudden terror doth unman,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Who, while he looks, delays not his departure;
<lb/>And I beheld behind us a black devil,
<lb/>Running along upon the crag, approach.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Ah, how ferocious was he in his aspect!
<lb/>And how he seemed to me in action ruthless,
<lb/>With open wings and light upon his feet!
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>His shoulders, which sharp-pointed were and high,
<lb/>A sinner did encumber with both haunches,
<lb/>And he held clutched the sinews of the feet.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>From off our bridge, he said: "O Malebranche,
<lb/>Behold one of the elders of Saint Zita;
<lb/><punishment_phrase><torture_word synset="plunge.v.05">Plunge</torture_word> him beneath</punishment_phrase>, for I return for others
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Unto that town, which is well furnished with them.
<lb/>All there are barrators, except Bonturo;
<lb/>No into Yes for money there is changed."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/><punishment_phrase>He <torture_word synset="hurl.v.01">hurled</torture_word> him down, and over the hard crag
<lb/>Turned round, and never was a mastiff loosened
<lb/>In so much hurry to pursue a thief.</punishment_phrase>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The other sank, and rose again face downward;
<lb/>But the demons, under cover of the bridge,
<lb/>Cried: "Here the Santo Volto has no place!
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Here swims one otherwise than in the Serchio;
<lb/>Therefore, if for our gaffs thou wishest not,
<lb/>Do not uplift thyself above the pitch."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/><punishment_phrase>They seized him then with more than a hundred <torture_word synset="rake.n.03">rakes</torture_word>;</punishment_phrase>
<lb/>They said: "It here behoves thee to dance covered,
<lb/>That, if thou canst, thou secretly mayest pilfer."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Not otherwise the cooks their scullions make
<lb/>Immerse into the middle of the caldron
<lb/>The meat with hooks, so that it may not float.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Said the good Master to me: "That it be not
<lb/>Apparent thou art here, crouch thyself down
<lb/>Behind a jag, that thou mayest have some screen;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And for no outrage that is done to me
<lb/>Be thou afraid, because these things I know,
<lb/>For once before was I in such a scuffle."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then he passed on beyond the bridge's head,
<lb/>And as upon the sixth bank he arrived,
<lb/>Need was for him to have a steadfast front.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>With the same fury, and the same uproar,
<lb/>As dogs leap out upon a mendicant,
<lb/>Who on a sudden begs, where'er he stops,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>They issued from beneath the little bridge,
<lb/>And turned against him all their grappling-irons;
<lb/>But he cried out: "Be none of you malignant!
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Before those hooks of yours lay hold of me,
<lb/>Let one of you step forward, who may hear me,
<lb/>And then take counsel as to grappling me."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>They all cried out: "Let Malacoda go;"
<lb/>Whereat one started, and the rest stood still,
<lb/>And he came to him, saying: "What avails it?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Thinkest thou, Malacoda, to behold me
<lb/>Advanced into this place," my Master said,
<lb/>"Safe hitherto from all your skill of fence,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Without the will divine, and fate auspicious?
<lb/>Let me go on, for it in Heaven is willed
<lb/>That I another show this savage road."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then was his arrogance so humbled in him,
<lb/>That he let fall his grapnel at his feet,
<lb/>And to the others said: "Now strike him not."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And unto me my Guide: "O thou, who sittest
<lb/>Among the splinters of the bridge crouched down,
<lb/>Securely now return to me again."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Wherefore I started and came swiftly to him;
<lb/>And all the devils forward thrust themselves,
<lb/>So that I feared they would not keep their compact.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And thus beheld I once afraid the soldiers
<lb/>Who issued under safeguard from Caprona,
<lb/>Seeing themselves among so many foes.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Close did I press myself with all my person
<lb/>Beside my Leader, and turned not mine eyes
<lb/>From off their countenance, which was not good.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>They lowered their rakes, and "Wilt thou have me hit him,"
<lb/>They said to one another, "on the rump?"
<lb/>And answered: "Yes; see that thou nick him with it."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But the same demon who was holding parley
<lb/>With my Conductor turned him very quickly,
<lb/>And said: "Be quiet, be quiet, Scarmiglione;"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then said to us: "You can no farther go
<lb/>Forward upon this crag, because is lying
<lb/>All shattered, at the bottom, the sixth arch.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And if it still doth please you to go onward,
<lb/>Pursue your way along upon this rock;
<lb/>Near is another crag that yields a path.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Yesterday, five hours later than this hour,
<lb/>One thousand and two hundred sixty-six
<lb/>Years were complete, that here the way was broken.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I send in that direction some of mine
<lb/>To see if any one doth air himself;
<lb/>Go ye with them; for they will not be vicious.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Step forward, Alichino and Calcabrina,"
<lb/>Began he to cry out, "and thou, Cagnazzo;
<lb/>And Barbariccia, do thou guide the ten.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Come forward, Libicocco and Draghignazzo,
<lb/>And tusked Ciriatto and Graffiacane,
<lb/>And Farfarello and mad Rubicante;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Search ye all round about the boiling pitch;
<lb/>Let these be safe as far as the next crag,
<lb/>That all unbroken passes o'er the dens."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"O me! what is it, Master, that I see?
<lb/>Pray let us go," I said, "without an escort,
<lb/>If thou knowest how, since for myself I ask none.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>If thou art as observant as thy wont is,
<lb/>Dost thou not see that they do gnash their teeth,
<lb/>And with their brows are threatening woe to us?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And he to me: "I will not have thee fear;
<lb/>Let them gnash on, according to their fancy,
<lb/>Because they do it for those boiling wretches."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Along the left-hand dike they wheeled about;
<lb/>But first had each one thrust his tongue between
<lb/>His teeth towards their leader for a signal;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And he had made a trumpet of his rump.
</stanza>
        
<canto numeral="XXII"/>

<stanza>
<lb/>I have erewhile seen horsemen moving camp,
<lb/>Begin the storming, and their muster make,
<lb/>And sometimes starting off for their escape;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Vaunt-couriers have I seen upon your land,
<lb/>O Aretines, and foragers go forth,
<lb/>Tournaments stricken, and the joustings run,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Sometimes with trumpets and sometimes with bells,
<lb/>With kettle-drums, and signals of the castles,
<lb/>And with our own, and with outlandish things,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But never yet with bagpipe so uncouth
<lb/>Did I see horsemen move, nor infantry,
<lb/>Nor ship by any sign of land or star.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>We went upon our way with the ten demons;
<lb/>Ah, savage company! but in the church
<lb/>With saints, and in the tavern with the gluttons!
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Ever upon the pitch was my intent,
<lb/>To see the whole condition of that Bolgia,
<lb/><punishment_phrase>And of the people who therein were <torture_word synset="burn.v.01">burned</torture_word>.</punishment_phrase>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Even as the dolphins, when they make a sign

<lb/>That they should counsel take to save their vessel,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/><punishment_phrase>Thus sometimes, to alleviate his <pain_word>pain</pain_word>,
<lb/>One of the sinners would display his back,</punishment_phrase>
<lb/>And in less time conceal it than it lightens.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>As on the brink of water in a ditch
<lb/>The frogs stand only with their muzzles out,
<lb/>So that they hide their feet and other bulk,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>So upon every side the sinners stood;
<lb/>But ever as Barbariccia near them came,
<lb/>Thus underneath the boiling they withdrew.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I saw, and still my heart doth shudder at it,
<lb/>One waiting thus, even as it comes to pass
<lb/>One frog remains, and down another dives;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And Graffiacan, who most confronted him,
<lb/><punishment_phrase><torture_word synset="grapple.v.02">Grappled</torture_word> him by his tresses smeared with pitch,
<lb/>And drew him up, so that he seemed an otter.</punishment_phrase>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I knew, before, the names of all of them,
<lb/>So had I noted them when they were chosen,
<lb/>And when they called each other, listened how.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"O Rubicante, see that thou do lay
<lb/>Thy claws upon him, <punishment_phrase>so that thou mayst <torture_word>flay</torture_word> him</punishment_phrase>,"
<lb/>Cried all together the accursed ones.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And I: "My Master, see to it, if thou canst,
<lb/>That thou mayst know who is the luckless wight,
<lb/>Thus come into his adversaries' hands."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Near to the side of him my Leader drew,
<lb/>Asked of him whence he was; and he replied:
<lb/>"I in the kingdom of Navarre was born;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>My mother placed me servant to a lord,
<lb/>For she had borne me to a ribald knave,
<lb/>Destroyer of himself and of his things.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then I domestic was of good King Thibault;
<lb/>I set me there to practise barratry,
<lb/>For which I pay the reckoning in this heat."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And Ciriatto, from whose mouth projected,
<lb/>On either side, a tusk, as in a boar,
<lb/>Caused him to feel how one of them could rip.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Among malicious cats the mouse had come;
<lb/>But Barbariccia clasped him in his arms,
<lb/>And said: "Stand ye aside, <punishment_phrase>while I <torture_word>enfork</torture_word> him</punishment_phrase>."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And to my Master he turned round his head;
<lb/>"Ask him again," he said, "if more thou wish
<lb/>To know from him, before some one destroy him."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The Guide: "Now tell then of the other culprits;
<lb/>Knowest thou any one who is a Latian,
<lb/>Under the pitch?"  And he: "I separated
</stanza>

<lb/>Lately from one who was a neighbour to it;
<lb/>Would that I still were covered up with him,
<lb/>For I should fear not either claw nor hook!"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And Libicocco: "We have borne too much;"
<lb/><punishment_phrase>And with his grapnel seized him by the arm,
<lb/>So that, by rending, he <torture_word>tore</torture_word> off a tendon.</punishment_phrase>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Eke Draghignazzo wished to pounce upon him
<lb/>Down at the legs; whence their Decurion
<lb/>Turned round and round about with evil look.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>When they again somewhat were pacified,
<lb/>Of him, who still was looking at his wound,
<lb/>Demanded my Conductor without stay:
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Who was that one, from whom a luckless parting
<lb/>Thou sayest thou hast made, to come ashore?"
<lb/>And he replied: "It was the Friar Gomita,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>He of Gallura, vessel of all fraud,
<lb/>Who had the enemies of his Lord in hand,
<lb/>And dealt so with them each exults thereat;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Money he took, and let them smoothly off,
<lb/>As he says; and in other offices
<lb/>A barrator was he, not mean but sovereign.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Foregathers with him one Don Michael Zanche
<lb/>Of Logodoro; and of Sardinia
<lb/>To gossip never do their tongues feel tired.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>O me! see that one, how he grinds his teeth;
<lb/>Still farther would I speak, but am afraid
<lb/>Lest he to scratch my itch be making ready."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And the grand Provost, turned to Farfarello,
<lb/>Who rolled his eyes about as if to strike,
<lb/>Said: "Stand aside there, thou malicious bird."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"If you desire either to see or hear,"
<lb/>The terror-stricken recommenced thereon,
<lb/>"Tuscans or Lombards, I will make them come.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But let the Malebranche cease a little,
<lb/>So that these may not their revenges fear,
<lb/>And I, down sitting in this very place,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>For one that I am will make seven come,
<lb/>When I shall whistle, as our custom is
<lb/>To do whenever one of us comes out."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Cagnazzo at these words his muzzle lifted,
<lb/>Shaking his head, and said: "Just hear the trick
<lb/>Which he has thought of, down to throw himself!"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Whence he, who snares in great abundance had,
<lb/>Responded: "I by far too cunning am,
<lb/>When I procure for mine a greater sadness."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Alichin held not in, but running counter
<lb/>Unto the rest, said to him: "If thou dive,
<lb/>I will not follow thee upon the gallop,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But I will beat my wings above the pitch;
<lb/>The height be left, and be the bank a shield
<lb/>To see if thou alone dost countervail us."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>O thou who readest, thou shalt hear new sport!
<lb/>Each to the other side his eyes averted;
<lb/>He first, who most reluctant was to do it.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The Navarrese selected well his time;
<lb/>Planted his feet on land, and in a moment
<lb/>Leaped, and released himself from their design.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Whereat each one was suddenly stung with shame,
<lb/>But he most who was cause of the defeat;
<lb/>Therefore he moved, and cried: "Thou art o'ertakern."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But little it availed, for wings could not
<lb/>Outstrip the fear; the other one went under,
<lb/>And, flying, upward he his breast directed;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Not otherwise the duck upon a sudden
<lb/>Dives under, when the falcon is approaching,
<lb/>And upward he returneth cross and weary.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Infuriate at the mockery, Calcabrina
<lb/>Flying behind him followed close, desirous
<lb/>The other should escape, to have a quarrel.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And when the barrator had disappeared,
<lb/>He turned his talons upon his companion,
<lb/>And grappled with him right above the moat.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But sooth the other was a doughty sparhawk
<lb/>To clapperclaw him well; and both of them
<lb/>Fell in the middle of the boiling pond.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>A sudden intercessor was the heat;
<lb/>But ne'ertheless of rising there was naught,
<lb/>To such degree they had their wings belimed.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Lamenting with the others, Barbariccia
<lb/>Made four of them fly to the other side
<lb/>With all their gaffs, and very speedily
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>This side and that they to their posts descended;
<lb/>They stretched their hooks towards the pitch-ensnared,
<lb/>Who were already baked within the crust,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And in this manner busied did we leave them.
</stanza>

<canto numeral="XXIII"/>

<stanza>
<lb/>Silent, alone, and without company
<lb/>We went, the one in front, the other after,
<lb/>As go the Minor Friars along their way.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Upon the fable of Aesop was directed
<lb/>My thought, by reason of the present quarrel,
<lb/>Where he has spoken of the frog and mouse;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>For 'mo' and 'issa' are not more alike
<lb/>Than this one is to that, if well we couple
<lb/>End and beginning with a steadfast mind.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And even as one thought from another springs,
<lb/>So afterward from that was born another,
<lb/>Which the first fear within me double made.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thus did I ponder: "These on our account
<lb/>Are laughed to scorn, with injury and scoff
<lb/>So great, that much I think it must annoy them.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>If anger be engrafted on ill-will,
<lb/>They will come after us more merciless
<lb/>Than dog upon the leveret which he seizes,"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I felt my hair stand all on end already
<lb/>With terror, and stood backwardly intent,
<lb/>When said I: "Master, if thou hidest not
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thyself and me forthwith, of Malebranche
<lb/>I am in dread; we have them now behind us;
<lb/>I so imagine them, I already feel them."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And he: "If I were made of leaded glass,
<lb/>Thine outward image I should not attract
<lb/>Sooner to me than I imprint the inner.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Just now thy thoughts came in among my own,
<lb/>With similar attitude and similar face,
<lb/>So that of both one counsel sole I made.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>If peradventure the right bank so slope
<lb/>That we to the next Bolgia can descend,
<lb/>We shall escape from the imagined chase."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Not yet he finished rendering such opinion,
<lb/>When I beheld them come with outstretched wings,
<lb/>Not far remote, with will to seize upon us.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>My Leader on a sudden seized me up,
<lb/>Even as a mother who by noise is wakened,
<lb/>And close beside her sees the enkindled flames,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Who takes her son, and flies, and does not stop,
<lb/>Having more care of him than of herself,
<lb/>So that she clothes her only with a shift;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And downward from the top of the hard bank
<lb/>Supine he gave him to the pendent rock,
<lb/>That one side of the other Bolgia walls.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Ne'er ran so swiftly water through a sluice
<lb/>To turn the wheel of any land-built mill,
<lb/>When nearest to the paddles it approaches,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>As did my Master down along that border,
<lb/>Bearing me with him on his breast away,
<lb/>As his own son, and not as a companion.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Hardly the bed of the ravine below
<lb/>His feet had reached, ere they had reached the hill
<lb/>Right over us; but he was not afraid;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>For the high Providence, which had ordained
<lb/>To place them ministers of the fifth moat,
<lb/>The power of thence departing took from all.

<lb/>That Frederick used to put them on of straw.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>O everlastingly fatiguing mantle!
<lb/>Again we turned us, still to the left hand
<lb/>Along with them, intent on their sad plaint;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But owing to the weight, that weary folk
<lb/>Came on so tardily, that we were new
<lb/>In company at each motion of the haunch.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Whence I unto my Leader: "See thou find
<lb/>Some one who may by deed or name be known,
<lb/>And thus in going move thine eye about."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And one, who understood the Tuscan speech,
<lb/>Cried to us from behind: "Stay ye your feet,
<lb/>Ye, who so run athwart the dusky air!
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Perhaps thou'lt have from me what thou demandest."
<lb/>Whereat the Leader turned him, and said: "Wait,
<lb/>And then according to his pace proceed."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I stopped, and two beheld I show great haste
<lb/>Of spirit, in their faces, to be with me;
<lb/>But the burden and the narrow way delayed them.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>When they came up, long with an eye askance
<lb/>They scanned me without uttering a word.
<lb/>Then to each other turned, and said together:
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"He by the action of his throat seems living;
<lb/>And if they dead are, by what privilege
<lb/>Go they uncovered by the heavy stole?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then said to me: "Tuscan, who to the college
<lb/>Of miserable hypocrites art come,
<lb/>Do not disdain to tell us who thou art."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And I to them: "Born was I, and grew up
<lb/>In the great town on the fair river of Arno,
<lb/>And with the body am I've always had.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But who are ye, in whom there trickles down
<lb/>Along your cheeks such grief as I behold?
<lb/>And what pain is upon you, that so sparkles?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And one replied to me: "<punishment_phrase>These orange cloaks
<lb/>Are made of <torture_word>lead</torture_word> so heavy, that the weights
<lb/>Cause in this way their balances to creak.</punishment_phrase>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Frati Gaudenti were we, and Bolognese;
<lb/>I Catalano, and he Loderingo
<lb/>Named, and together taken by thy city,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>As the wont is to take one man alone,
<lb/>For maintenance of its peace; and we were such
<lb/>That still it is apparent round Gardingo."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"O Friars," began I, "your iniquitous. . ."
<lb/>But said no more; for to mine eyes <punishment_phrase>there rushed
<lb/>One <torture_word>crucified</torture_word> with three stakes on the ground.</punishment_phrase>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>When me he saw, <punishment_phrase>he <pain_word>writhed</pain_word> himself all over,</punishment_phrase>
<lb/>Blowing into his beard with suspirations;
<lb/>And the Friar Catalan, who noticed this,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Said to me: "This transfixed one, whom thou seest,
<lb/>Counselled the Pharisees that it was meet
<lb/>To put one man to torture for the people.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/><punishment_phrase><torture_word>Crosswise</torture_word> and <torture_word synset="naked.s.05">naked</torture_word> is he on the path,</punishment_phrase>

</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And in like mode his father-in-law is punished
<lb/>Within this moat, and the others of the council,
<lb/>Which for the Jews was a malignant seed."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And thereupon I saw Virgilius marvel
<lb/>O'er him who was extended on the cross
<lb/>So vilely in eternal banishment.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then he directed to the Friar this voice:
<lb/>"Be not displeased, if granted thee, to tell us
<lb/>If to the right hand any pass slope down
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>By which we two may issue forth from here,
<lb/>Without constraining some of the black angels
<lb/>To come and extricate us from this deep."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then he made answer: "Nearer than thou hopest
<lb/>There is a rock, that forth from the great circle
<lb/>Proceeds, and crosses all the cruel valleys,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Save that at this 'tis broken, and does not bridge it;
<lb/>You will be able to mount up the ruin,
<lb/>That sidelong slopes and at the bottom rises."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The Leader stood awhile with head bowed down;
<lb/>Then said: "The business badly he recounted
<lb/>Who grapples with his hook the sinners yonder."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And the Friar: "Many of the Devil's vices
<lb/>Once heard I at Bologna, and among them,
<lb/>That he's a liar and the father of lies."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thereat my Leader with great strides went on,
<lb/>Somewhat disturbed with anger in his looks;
<lb/>Whence from the heavy-laden I departed
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>After the prints of his beloved feet.

<lb/>In that part of the youthful year wherein
<lb/>The Sun his locks beneath Aquarius tempers,

<lb/>What time the hoar-frost copies on the ground
<lb/>The outward semblance of her sister white,

</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The husbandman, whose forage faileth him,
<lb/>Rises, and looks, and seeth the champaign

<lb/>Returns in doors, and up and down laments,

</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Seeing the world has changed its countenance
<lb/>In little time, and takes his shepherd's crook,
<lb/>And forth the little lambs to pasture drives.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thus did the Master fill me with alarm,
<lb/>When I beheld his forehead so disturbed,
<lb/>And to the ailment came as soon the plaster.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>For as we came unto the ruined bridge,
<lb/>The Leader turned to me with that sweet look
<lb/>Which at the mountain's foot I first beheld.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>His arms he opened, after some advisement
<lb/>Within himself elected, looking first
<lb/>Well at the ruin, and laid hold of me.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And even as he who acts and meditates,
<lb/>For aye it seems that he provides beforehand,
<lb/>So upward lifting me towards the summit
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Of a huge rock, he scanned another crag,
<lb/>Saying: "To that one grapple afterwards,
<lb/>But try first if 'tis such that it will hold thee."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>This was no way for one clothed with a cloak;
<lb/>For hardly we, he light, and I pushed upward,
<lb/>Were able to ascend from jag to jag.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And had it not been, that upon that precinct
<lb/>Shorter was the ascent than on the other,
<lb/>He I know not, but I had been dead beat.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But because Malebolge tow'rds the mouth
<lb/>Of the profoundest well is all inclining,
<lb/>The structure of each valley doth import
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>That one bank rises and the other sinks.
<lb/>Still we arrived at length upon the point
<lb/>Wherefrom the last stone breaks itself asunder.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The breath was from my lungs so milked away,
<lb/>When I was up, that I could go no farther,
<lb/>Nay, I sat down upon my first arrival.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Now it behoves thee thus to put off sloth,"
<lb/>My Master said; "for sitting upon down,
<lb/>Or under quilt, one cometh not to fame,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Withouten which whoso his life consumes
<lb/>Such vestige leaveth of himself on earth,
<lb/>As smoke in air or in the water foam.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And therefore raise thee up, o'ercome the anguish
<lb/>With spirit that o'ercometh every battle,
<lb/>If with its heavy body it sink not.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>A longer stairway it behoves thee mount;
<lb/>'Tis not enough from these to have departed;
<lb/>Let it avail thee, if thou understand me."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then I uprose, showing myself provided
<lb/>Better with breath than I did feel myself,
<lb/>And said: "Go on, for I am strong and bold."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Upward we took our way along the crag,
<lb/>Which jagged was, and narrow, and difficult,
<lb/>And more precipitous far than that before.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Speaking I went, not to appear exhausted;
<lb/>Whereat a voice from the next moat came forth,
<lb/>Not well adapted to articulate words.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I know not what it said, though o'er the back
<lb/>I now was of the arch that passes there;
<lb/>But he seemed moved to anger who was speaking.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I was bent downward, but my living eyes
<lb/>Could not attain the bottom, for the dark;
<lb/>Wherefore I: "Master, see that thou arrive
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>At the next round, and let us descend the wall;
<lb/>For as from hence I hear and understand not,
<lb/>So I look down and nothing I distinguish."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Other response," he said, "I make thee not,
<lb/>Except the doing; for the modest asking
<lb/>Ought to be followed by the deed in silence."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>We from the bridge descended at its head,
<lb/>Where it connects itself with the eighth bank,
<lb/>And then was manifest to me the Bolgia;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/><punishment_phrase>And I beheld therein a terrible throng

<lb/>Without the hope of hole or heliotrope.

<lb/><punishment_phrase>They had their hands with serpents <torture_word>bound</torture_word> behind them;

<lb/><punishment_phrase>Nor 'O' so quickly e'er, nor 'I' was written,

<stanza>
<lb/>And when he on the ground was thus destroyed,

<lb/>Even thus by the great sages 'tis confessed

<lb/>On herb or grain it feeds not in its life,
<lb/>But only on tears of incense and amomum,
<lb/>And nard and myrrh are its last winding-sheet.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And as he is who falls, and knows not how,

<stanza>
<lb/>When he arises and around him looks,

<lb/>Such was that sinner after he had risen.
<lb/>Justice of God! O how severe it is,

</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The Guide thereafter asked him who he was;
<lb/>Whence he replied: "I rained from Tuscany

<stanza>
<lb/>A bestial life, and not a human, pleased me,

<lb/>The mace of Hercules, who peradventure
<lb/>Gave him a hundred, and he felt not ten."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>While he was speaking thus, he had passed by,
<lb/>And spirits three had underneath us come,
<lb/>Of which nor I aware was, nor my Leader,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Until what time they shouted: "Who are you?"
<lb/>On which account our story made a halt,
<lb/>And then we were intent on them alone.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I did not know them; but it came to pass,
<lb/>As it is wont to happen by some chance,
<lb/>That one to name the other was compelled,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Exclaiming: "Where can Cianfa have remained?"
<lb/>Whence I, so that the Leader might attend,
<lb/>Upward from chin to nose my finger laid.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>If thou art, Reader, slow now to believe
<lb/>What I shall say, it will no marvel be,
<lb/>For I who saw it hardly can admit it.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>As I was holding raised on them my brows,
<lb/>Behold! a serpent with six feet darts forth
<lb/>In front of one, and fastens wholly on him.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>With middle feet it bound him round the paunch,
<lb/>And with the forward ones his arms it seized;
<lb/><punishment_phrase>Then <torture_word>thrust</torture_word> its teeth through one cheek and the other;</punishment_phrase>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The hindermost it stretched upon his thighs,
<lb/>And put its tail through in between the two,
<lb/>And up behind along the reins outspread it.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Ivy was never fastened by its barbs
<lb/>Unto a tree so, as this horrible reptile
<lb/><punishment_phrase>Upon the other's limbs <torture_word>entwined</torture_word> its own.</punishment_phrase>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then they stuck close, as if of heated wax
<lb/>They had been made, and intermixed their colour;
<lb/>Nor one nor other seemed now what he was;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>E'en as proceedeth on before the flame
<lb/>Upward along the paper a brown colour,
<lb/>Which is not black as yet, and the white dies.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The other two looked on, and each of them
<lb/>Cried out: "O me, Agnello, how thou changest!
<lb/>Behold, thou now art neither two nor one."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Already the two heads had one become,
<lb/>When there appeared to us two figures mingled
<lb/>Into one face, wherein the two were lost.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Of the four lists were fashioned the two arms,
<lb/>The thighs and legs, the belly and the chest
<lb/>Members became that never yet were seen.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Every original aspect there was cancelled;
<lb/>Two and yet none did the perverted image
<lb/>Appear, and such departed with slow pace.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Even as a lizard, under the great scourge
<lb/>Of days canicular, exchanging hedge,
<lb/>Lightning appeareth if the road it cross;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thus did appear, coming towards the bellies
<lb/>Of the two others, a small fiery serpent,
<lb/>Livid and black as is a peppercorn.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And in that part whereat is first received
<lb/>Our aliment, it one of them transfixed;
<lb/>Then downward fell in front of him extended.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The one transfixed looked at it, but said naught;
<lb/>Nay, rather with feet motionless he yawned,
<lb/>Just as if sleep or fever had assailed him.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>He at the serpent gazed, and it at him;
<lb/>One through the wound, the other through the mouth
<lb/>Smoked violently, and the smoke commingled.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Henceforth be silent Lucan, where he mentions
<lb/>Wretched Sabellus and Nassidius,
<lb/>And wait to hear what now shall be shot forth.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Be silent Ovid, of Cadmus and Arethusa;
<lb/>For if him to a snake, her to fountain,
<lb/>Converts he fabling, that I grudge him not;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Because two natures never front to front
<lb/>Has he transmuted, so that both the forms
<lb/>To interchange their matter ready were.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Together they responded in such wise,
<lb/>That to a fork the serpent cleft his tail,
<lb/>And eke the wounded drew his feet together.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The legs together with the thighs themselves
<lb/>Adhered so, that in little time the juncture
<lb/>No sign whatever made that was apparent.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>He with the cloven tail assumed the figure
<lb/>The other one was losing, and his skin
<lb/>Became elastic, and the other's hard.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I saw the arms draw inward at the armpits,
<lb/>And both feet of the reptile, that were short,
<lb/>Lengthen as much as those contracted were.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thereafter the hind feet, together twisted,
<lb/>Became the member that a man conceals,
<lb/>And of his own the wretch had two created.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>While both of them the exhalation veils
<lb/>With a new colour, and engenders hair
<lb/>On one of them and depilates the other,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The one uprose and down the other fell,
<lb/>Though turning not away their impious lamps,
<lb/>Underneath which each one his muzzle changed.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>He who was standing drew it tow'rds the temples,
<lb/>And from excess of matter, which came thither,
<lb/>Issued the ears from out the hollow cheeks;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>What did not backward run and was retained
<lb/>Of that excess made to the face a nose,
<lb/>And the lips thickened far as was befitting.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>He who lay prostrate thrusts his muzzle forward,
<lb/>And backward draws the ears into his head,
<lb/>In the same manner as the snail its horns;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And so the tongue, which was entire and apt
<lb/>For speech before, is cleft, and the bi-forked
<lb/>In the other closes up, and the smoke ceases.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The soul, which to a reptile had been changed,
<lb/>Along the valley hissing takes to flight,
<lb/>And after him the other speaking sputters.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then did he turn upon him his new shoulders,
<lb/>And said to the other: "I'll have Buoso run,
<lb/>Crawling as I have done, along this road."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>In this way I beheld the seventh ballast
<lb/>Shift and reshift, and here be my excuse
<lb/>The novelty, if aught my pen transgress.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And notwithstanding that mine eyes might be
<lb/>Somewhat bewildered, and my mind dismayed,
<lb/>They could not flee away so secretly
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But that I plainly saw Puccio Sciancato;
<lb/>And he it was who sole of three companions,
<lb/>Which came in the beginning, was not changed;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The other was he whom thou, Gaville, weepest.

<stanza>
<lb/>We went our way, and up along the stairs

<stanza>
<lb/>And following the solitary path
<lb/>Among the rocks and ridges of the crag,

<stanza>
<lb/>With flames as manifold resplendent all
<lb/>Was the eighth Bolgia, as I grew aware
<lb/>As soon as I was where the depth appeared.

<stanza>
<lb/>And such as he who with the bears avenged him
<lb/>Beheld Elijah's chariot at departing,
<lb/>What time the steeds to heaven erect uprose,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>For with his eye he could not follow it
<lb/>So as to see aught else than flame alone,
<lb/>Even as a little cloud ascending upward,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thus each along the gorge of the intrenchment
<lb/>Was moving; for not one reveals the theft,
<lb/>And every flame a sinner steals away.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I stood upon the bridge uprisen to see,
<lb/>So that, if I had seized not on a rock,
<lb/>Down had I fallen without being pushed.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And the Leader, who beheld me so attent,
<lb/>Exclaimed: "<punishment_phrase>Within the <torture_word>fires</torture_word> the spirits are;
<lb/>Each swathes himself with that wherewith he <torture_word synset="burn.n.01">burns</torture_word>."</punishment_phrase>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"My Master," I replied, "by hearing thee
<lb/>I am more sure; but I surmised already
<lb/>It might be so, and already wished to ask thee
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Who is within that fire, which comes so cleft
<lb/>At top, it seems uprising from the pyre
<lb/>Where was Eteocles with his brother placed."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>He answered me: "Within there are tormented
<lb/>Ulysses and Diomed, and thus together
<lb/>They unto vengeance run as unto wrath.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And there within their flame do they lament
<lb/>The ambush of the horse, which made the door
<lb/>Whence issued forth the Romans' gentle seed;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Therein is wept the craft, for which being dead
<lb/>Deidamia still deplores Achilles,
<lb/>And pain for the Palladium there is borne."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"If they within those sparks possess the power
<lb/>To speak," I said, "thee, Master, much I pray,
<lb/>And re-pray, that the prayer be worth a thousand,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>That thou make no denial of awaiting
<lb/>Until the horned flame shall hither come;
<lb/>Thou seest that with desire I lean towards it."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And he to me: "Worthy is thy entreaty
<lb/>Of much applause, and therefore I accept it;
<lb/>But take heed that thy tongue restrain itself.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Leave me to speak, because I have conceived
<lb/>That which thou wishest; for they might disdain
<lb/>Perchance, since they were Greeks, discourse of thine."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>When now the flame had come unto that point,
<lb/>Where to my Leader it seemed time and place,
<lb/>After this fashion did I hear him speak:
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"O ye, who are twofold within one fire,
<lb/>If I deserved of you, while I was living,
<lb/>If I deserved of you or much or little
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>When in the world I wrote the lofty verses,
<lb/>Do not move on, but one of you declare
<lb/>Whither, being lost, he went away to die."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then of the antique flame the greater horn,
<lb/>Murmuring, began to wave itself about
<lb/>Even as a flame doth which the wind fatigues.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thereafterward, the summit to and fro
<lb/>Moving as if it were the tongue that spake,
<lb/>It uttered forth a voice, and said: "When I
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>From Circe had departed, who concealed me
<lb/>More than a year there near unto Gaeta,
<lb/>Or ever yet Aeneas named it so,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence
<lb/>For my old father, nor the due affection
<lb/>Which joyous should have made Penelope,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Could overcome within me the desire
<lb/>I had to be experienced of the world,
<lb/>And of the vice and virtue of mankind;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But I put forth on the high open sea
<lb/>With one sole ship, and that small company
<lb/>By which I never had deserted been.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Both of the shores I saw as far as Spain,
<lb/>Far as Morocco, and the isle of Sardes,
<lb/>And the others which that sea bathes round about.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I and my company were old and slow
<lb/>When at that narrow passage we arrived
<lb/>Where Hercules his landmarks set as signals,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>That man no farther onward should adventure.
<lb/>On the right hand behind me left I Seville,
<lb/>And on the other already had left Ceuta.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>'O brothers, who amid a hundred thousand
<lb/>Perils,' I said, 'have come unto the West,
<lb/>To this so inconsiderable vigil
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Which is remaining of your senses still
<lb/>Be ye unwilling to deny the knowledge,
<lb/>Following the sun, of the unpeopled world.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Consider ye the seed from which ye sprang;
<lb/>Ye were not made to live like unto brutes,
<lb/>But for pursuit of virtue and of knowledge.'
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>So eager did I render my companions,
<lb/>With this brief exhortation, for the voyage,
<lb/>That then I hardly could have held them back.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And having turned our stern unto the morning,
<lb/>We of the oars made wings for our mad flight,
<lb/>Evermore gaining on the larboard side.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Already all the stars of the other pole
<lb/>The night beheld, and ours so very low
<lb/>It did not rise above the ocean floor.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Five times rekindled and as many quenched
<lb/>Had been the splendour underneath the moon,
<lb/>Since we had entered into the deep pass,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>When there appeared to us a mountain, dim
<lb/>From distance, and it seemed to me so high
<lb/>As I had never any one beheld.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Joyful were we, and soon it turned to weeping;
<lb/>For out of the new land a whirlwind rose,
<lb/>And smote upon the fore part of the ship.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Three times it made her whirl with all the waters,
<lb/>At the fourth time it made the stern uplift,
<lb/>And the prow downward go, as pleased Another,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Until the sea above us closed again."
</stanza>

<canto numeral="XXVII"/>

<stanza>
<lb/>Already was the flame erect and quiet,
<lb/>To speak no more, and now departed from us
<lb/>With the permission of the gentle Poet;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>When yet another, which behind it came,
<lb/>Caused us to turn our eyes upon its top
<lb/>By a confused sound that issued from it.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>As the Sicilian bull (that bellowed first
<lb/>With the lament of him, and that was right,
<lb/>Who with his file had modulated it)
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Bellowed so with the voice of the afflicted,
<lb/>That, notwithstanding it was made of brass,
<lb/>Still it appeared with agony transfixed;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thus, by not having any way or issue
<lb/>At first from out the fire, to its own language
<lb/>Converted were the melancholy words.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But afterwards, when they had gathered way
<lb/>Up through the point, giving it that vibration
<lb/>The tongue had given them in their passage out,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>We heard it said: "O thou, at whom I aim
<lb/>My voice, and who but now wast speaking Lombard,
<lb/>Saying, 'Now go thy way, no more I urge thee,'
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Because I come perchance a little late,
<lb/>To stay and speak with me let it not irk thee;
<lb/>Thou seest it irks not me, and I am burning.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>If thou but lately into this blind world
<lb/>Hast fallen down from that sweet Latian land,
<lb/>Wherefrom I bring the whole of my transgression,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Say, if the Romagnuols have peace or war,
<lb/>For I was from the mountains there between
<lb/>Urbino and the yoke whence Tiber bursts."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I still was downward bent and listening,
<lb/>When my Conductor touched me on the side,
<lb/>Saying: "Speak thou: this one a Latian is."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And I, who had beforehand my reply
<lb/>In readiness, forthwith began to speak:
<lb/>"O soul, that down below there art concealed,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Romagna thine is not and never has been
<lb/>Without war in the bosom of its tyrants;
<lb/>But open war I none have left there now.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Ravenna stands as it long years has stood;
<lb/>The Eagle of Polenta there is brooding,
<lb/>So that she covers Cervia with her vans.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The city which once made the long resistance,
<lb/>And of the French a sanguinary heap,
<lb/>Beneath the Green Paws finds itself again;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Verrucchio's ancient Mastiff and the new,
<lb/>Who made such bad disposal of Montagna,
<lb/>Where they are wont make wimbles of their teeth.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The cities of Lamone and Santerno
<lb/>Governs the Lioncel of the white lair,
<lb/>Who changes sides 'twixt summer-time and winter;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And that of which the Savio bathes the flank,
<lb/>Even as it lies between the plain and mountain,
<lb/>Lives between tyranny and a free state.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Now I entreat thee tell us who thou art;
<lb/>Be not more stubborn than the rest have been,
<lb/>So may thy name hold front there in the world."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>After the fire a little more had roared
<lb/>In its own fashion, the sharp point it moved
<lb/>This way and that, and then gave forth such breath:
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"If I believed that my reply were made
<lb/>To one who to the world would e'er return,
<lb/>This flame without more flickering would stand still;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But inasmuch as never from this depth
<lb/>Did any one return, if I hear true,
<lb/>Without the fear of infamy I answer,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I was a man of arms, then Cordelier,
<lb/>Believing thus begirt to make amends;
<lb/>And truly my belief had been fulfilled
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But for the High Priest, whom may ill betide,
<lb/>Who put me back into my former sins;
<lb/>And how and wherefore I will have thee hear.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>While I was still the form of bone and pulp
<lb/>My mother gave to me, the deeds I did
<lb/>Were not those of a lion, but a fox.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The machinations and the covert ways
<lb/>I knew them all, and practised so their craft,
<lb/>That to the ends of earth the sound went forth.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>When now unto that portion of mine age
<lb/>I saw myself arrived, when each one ought
<lb/>To lower the sails, and coil away the ropes,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>That which before had pleased me then displeased me;
<lb/>And penitent and confessing I surrendered,
<lb/>Ah woe is me! and it would have bestead me;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The Leader of the modern Pharisees
<lb/>Having a war near unto Lateran,
<lb/>And not with Saracens nor with the Jews,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>For each one of his enemies was Christian,
<lb/>And none of them had been to conquer Acre,
<lb/>Nor merchandising in the Sultan's land,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Nor the high office, nor the sacred orders,
<lb/>In him regarded, nor in me that cord
<lb/>Which used to make those girt with it more meagre;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But even as Constantine sought out Sylvester
<lb/>To cure his leprosy, within Soracte,
<lb/>So this one sought me out as an adept
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>To cure him of the fever of his pride.
<lb/>Counsel he asked of me, and I was silent,
<lb/>Because his words appeared inebriate.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And then he said: 'Be not thy heart afraid;
<lb/>Henceforth I thee absolve; and thou instruct me
<lb/>How to raze Palestrina to the ground.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Heaven have I power to lock and to unlock,
<lb/>As thou dost know; therefore the keys are two,
<lb/>The which my predecessor held not dear.'
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then urged me on his weighty arguments
<lb/>There, where my silence was the worst advice;
<lb/>And said I: 'Father, since thou washest me
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Of that sin into which I now must fall,
<lb/>The promise long with the fulfilment short
<lb/>Will make thee triumph in thy lofty seat.'
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Francis came afterward, when I was dead,
<lb/>For me; but one of the black Cherubim
<lb/>Said to him: 'Take him not; do me no wrong;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>He must come down among my servitors,
<lb/>Because he gave the fraudulent advice
<lb/>From which time forth I have been at his hair;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>For who repents not cannot be absolved,
<lb/>Nor can one both repent and will at once,
<lb/>Because of the contradiction which consents not.'
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>O miserable me! how I did shudder
<lb/>When he seized on me, saying: 'Peradventure
<lb/>Thou didst not think that I was a logician!'
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>He bore me unto Minos, who entwined
<lb/>Eight times his tail about his stubborn back,
<lb/>And after he had bitten it in great rage,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Said: 'Of the thievish fire a culprit this;'
<lb/>Wherefore, here where thou seest, am I lost,
<lb/>And vested thus in going I bemoan me."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>When it had thus completed its recital,
<lb/>The flame departed uttering lamentations,
<lb/>Writhing and flapping its sharp-pointed horn.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Onward we passed, both I and my Conductor,
<lb/>Up o'er the crag above another arch,
<lb/>Which the moat covers, where is paid the fee

<lb/>When we have gone around the doleful road;
<lb/>By reason that our wounds are closed again
<lb/>Ere any one in front of him repass.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But who art thou, that musest on the crag,
<lb/>Perchance to postpone going to the pain
<lb/>That is adjudged upon thine accusations?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Nor death hath reached him yet, nor guilt doth bring him,"
<lb/>My Master made reply, "to be tormented;
<lb/>But to procure him full experience,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Me, who am dead, behoves it to conduct him
<lb/>Down here through Hell, from circle unto circle;
<lb/>And this is true as that I speak to thee."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>More than a hundred were there when they heard him,
<lb/>Who in the moat stood still to look at me,
<lb/>Through wonderment oblivious of their torture.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Now say to Fra Dolcino, then, to arm him,
<lb/>Thou, who perhaps wilt shortly see the sun,
<lb/>If soon he wish not here to follow me,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>So with provisions, that no stress of snow
<lb/>May give the victory to the Novarese,
<lb/>Which otherwise to gain would not be easy."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>After one foot to go away he lifted,
<lb/>This word did Mahomet say unto me,
<lb/>Then to depart upon the ground he stretched it.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Another one, who had his throat pierced through,
<lb/>And nose cut off close underneath the brows,
<lb/>And had no longer but a single ear,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Staying to look in wonder with the others,
<lb/>Before the others did his gullet open,
<lb/>Which outwardly was red in every part,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And said: "O thou, whom guilt doth not condemn,
<lb/>And whom I once saw up in Latian land,
<lb/>Unless too great similitude deceive me,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Call to remembrance Pier da Medicina,
<lb/>If e'er thou see again the lovely plain
<lb/>That from Vercelli slopes to Marcabo,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And make it known to the best two of Fano,
<lb/>To Messer Guido and Angiolello likewise,
<lb/>That if foreseeing here be not in vain,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Cast over from their vessel shall they be,
<lb/>And drowned near unto the Cattolica,
<lb/>By the betrayal of a tyrant fell.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Between the isles of Cyprus and Majorca
<lb/>Neptune ne'er yet beheld so great a crime,
<lb/>Neither of pirates nor Argolic people.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>That traitor, who sees only with one eye,
<lb/>And holds the land, which some one here with me
<lb/>Would fain be fasting from the vision of,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Will make them come unto a parley with him;
<lb/>Then will do so, that to Focara's wind
<lb/>They will not stand in need of vow or prayer."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And I to him: "Show to me and declare,
<lb/>If thou wouldst have me bear up news of thee,
<lb/>Who is this person of the bitter vision."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then did he lay his hand upon the jaw
<lb/>Of one of his companions, and his mouth
<lb/>Oped, crying: "This is he, and he speaks not.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>This one, being banished, every doubt submerged
<lb/>In Caesar by affirming the forearmed
<lb/>Always with detriment allowed delay."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/><punishment_phrase>O how <pain_word>bewildered</pain_word> unto me appeared,
<lb/>With tongue asunder in his windpipe <torture_word synset="slit.v.02">slit</torture_word>,</punishment_phrase>
<lb/>Curio, who in speaking was so bold!
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And one, who both his hands dissevered had,
<lb/>The stumps uplifting through the murky air,
<lb/>So that the blood made horrible his face,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Cried out: "Thou shalt remember Mosca also,
<lb/>Who said, alas! 'A thing done has an end!'
<lb/>Which was an ill seed for the Tuscan people."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"And death unto thy race," thereto I added;
<lb/>Whence he, accumulating woe on woe,
<lb/>Departed, like a person sad and crazed.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But I remained to look upon the crowd;
<lb/>And saw a thing which I should be afraid,
<lb/>Without some further proof, even to recount,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>If it were not that conscience reassures me,
<lb/>That good companion which emboldens man
<lb/>Beneath the hauberk of its feeling pure.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I truly saw, and still I seem to see it,
<lb/><punishment_phrase>A trunk without a head walk in like manner</punishment_phrase>
<lb/>As walked the others of the mournful herd.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And by the hair it held the <punishment_phrase>head <torture_word synset="divide.v.01">dissevered</torture_word>,</punishment_phrase>
<lb/>Hung from the hand in fashion of a lantern,
<lb/>And that upon us gazed and said: "O me!"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>It of itself made to itself a lamp,
<lb/>And they were two in one, and one in two;
<lb/>How that can be, He knows who so ordains it.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>When it was come close to the bridge's foot,
<lb/>It lifted high its arm with all the head,
<lb/>To bring more closely unto us its words,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Which were: "Behold now the sore penalty,
<lb/>Thou, who dost breathing go the dead beholding;
<lb/>Behold if any be as great as this.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And so that thou may carry news of me,
<lb/>Know that Bertram de Born am I, the same
<lb/>Who gave to the Young King the evil comfort.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I made the father and the son rebellious;
<lb/>Achitophel not more with Absalom
<lb/>And David did with his accursed goadings.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Because I parted persons so united,
<lb/>Parted do I now bear my brain, alas!
<lb/>From its beginning, which is in this trunk.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thus is observed in me the counterpoise."

<lb/>The many people and the divers wounds
<lb/>These eyes of mine had so inebriated,
<lb/>That they were wishful to stand still and weep;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But said Virgilius: "What dost thou still gaze at?
<lb/>Why is thy sight still riveted down there
<lb/>Among the mournful, mutilated shades?
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thou hast not done so at the other Bolge;
<lb/>Consider, if to count them thou believest,
<lb/>That two-and-twenty miles the valley winds,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And now the moon is underneath our feet;
<lb/>Henceforth the time allotted us is brief,
<lb/>And more is to be seen than what thou seest."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"If thou hadst," I made answer thereupon,
<lb/>"Attended to the cause for which I looked,
<lb/>Perhaps a longer stay thou wouldst have pardoned."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Meanwhile my Guide departed, and behind him
<lb/>I went, already making my reply,
<lb/>And superadding: "In that cavern where
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I held mine eyes with such attention fixed,
<lb/>I think a spirit of my blood laments
<lb/>The sin which down below there costs so much."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then said the Master: "Be no longer broken
<lb/>Thy thought from this time forward upon him;
<lb/>Attend elsewhere, and there let him remain;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>For him I saw below the little bridge,
<lb/>Pointing at thee, and threatening with his finger
<lb/>Fiercely, and heard him called Geri del Bello.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>So wholly at that time wast thou impeded
<lb/>By him who formerly held Altaforte,
<lb/>Thou didst not look that way; so he departed."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"O my Conductor, his own violent death,
<lb/>Which is not yet avenged for him," I said,
<lb/>"By any who is sharer in the shame,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Made him disdainful; whence he went away,
<lb/>As I imagine, without speaking to me,
<lb/>And thereby made me pity him the more."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thus did we speak as far as the first place
<lb/>Upon the crag, which the next valley shows
<lb/>Down to the bottom, if there were more light.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>When we were now right over the last cloister
<lb/>Of Malebolge, so that its lay-brothers
<lb/>Could manifest themselves unto our sight,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/><punishment_phrase>Divers <pain_word>lamentings</pain_word> pierced me through and through,</punishment_phrase>
<lb/>Which with compassion had their arrows barbed,

<lb/>What pain would be, if from the hospitals

</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/><punishment_phrase>All the <torture_word synset="disease.n.01">diseases</torture_word> in one moat were gathered,

<lb/>As from putrescent limbs is wont to issue.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>We had descended on the furthest bank
<lb/>From the long crag, upon the left hand still,
<lb/>And then more vivid was my power of sight
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Down tow'rds the bottom, where the ministress
<lb/>Of the high Lord, Justice infallible,
<lb/>Punishes forgers, which she here records.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I do not think a sadder sight to see
<lb/>Was in Aegina the whole people sick,
<lb/>(When was the air so full of pestilence,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The animals, down to the little worm,
<lb/>All fell, and afterwards the ancient people,
<lb/>According as the poets have affirmed,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Were from the seed of ants restored again,)
<lb/>Than was it to behold through that dark valley
<lb/>The spirits languishing in divers heaps.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>This on the belly, that upon the back
<lb/>One of the other lay, and others crawling
<lb/>Shifted themselves along the dismal road.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>We step by step went onward without speech,
<lb/>Gazing upon and listening to the sick
<lb/>Who had not strength enough to lift their bodies.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I saw two sitting leaned against each other,
<lb/>As leans in heating platter against platter,
<lb/><punishment_phrase>From head to foot bespotted o'er with <torture_word synset="scab.n.02">scabs</torture_word></punishment_phrase>;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And never saw I plied a currycomb
<lb/>By stable-boy for whom his master waits,
<lb/>Or him who keeps awake unwillingly,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/><punishment_phrase>As every one was plying fast the bite
<lb/>Of nails upon himself, for the great rage
<lb/>Of <torture_word synset="itch.n.03">itching</torture_word></punishment_phrase> which no other succour had.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And the nails downward with them dragged the scab,
<lb/>In fashion as a knife the scales of bream,
<lb/>Or any other fish that has them largest.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"O thou, that with thy fingers dost dismail thee,"
<lb/>Began my Leader unto one of them,
<lb/>"And makest of them pincers now and then,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Tell me if any Latian is with those
<lb/>Who are herein; so may thy nails suffice thee
<lb/>To all eternity unto this work."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Latians are we, whom thou so wasted seest,
<lb/>Both of us here," one weeping made reply;
<lb/>"But who art thou, that questionest about us?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And said the Guide: "One am I who descends
<lb/>Down with this living man from cliff to cliff,
<lb/>And I intend to show Hell unto him."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then broken was their mutual support,
<lb/>And trembling each one turned himself to me,
<lb/>With others who had heard him by rebound.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Wholly to me did the good Master gather,
<lb/>Saying: "Say unto them whate'er thou wishest."
<lb/>And I began, since he would have it so:
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"So may your memory not steal away
<lb/>In the first world from out the minds of men,
<lb/>But so may it survive 'neath many suns,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Say to me who ye are, and of what people;
<lb/>Let not your foul and loathsome punishment
<lb/>Make you afraid to show yourselves to me."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"I of Arezzo was," one made reply,
<lb/>"And Albert of Siena had me burned;
<lb/>But what I died for does not bring me here.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>'Tis true I said to him, speaking in jest,
<lb/>That I could rise by flight into the air,
<lb/>And he who had conceit, but little wit,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Would have me show to him the art; and only
<lb/>Because no Daedalus I made him, made me
<lb/>Be burned by one who held him as his son.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But unto the last Bolgia of the ten,
<lb/>For alchemy, which in the world I practised,
<lb/>Minos, who cannot err, has me condemned."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And to the Poet said I: "Now was ever
<lb/>So vain a people as the Sienese?
<lb/>Not for a certainty the French by far."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Whereat the other leper, who had heard me,
<lb/>Replied unto my speech: "Taking out Stricca,
<lb/>Who knew the art of moderate expenses,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And Niccolo, who the luxurious use
<lb/>Of cloves discovered earliest of all
<lb/>Within that garden where such seed takes root;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And taking out the band, among whom squandered
<lb/>Caccia d'Ascian his vineyards and vast woods,
<lb/>And where his wit the Abbagliato proffered!
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But, that thou know who thus doth second thee
<lb/>Against the Sienese, make sharp thine eye
<lb/>Tow'rds me, so that my face well answer thee,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And thou shalt see I am Capocchio's shade,

<stanza>
<lb/>How I a skilful ape of nature was."

<lb/>'Twas at the time when Juno was enraged,

</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>So reft of reason Athamas became,
<lb/>That, seeing his own wife with children twain
<lb/>Walking encumbered upon either hand,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>He cried: "Spread out the nets, that I may take
<lb/>The lioness and her whelps upon the passage;"
<lb/>And then extended his unpitying claws,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Seizing the first, who had the name Learchus,
<lb/>And whirled him round, and dashed him on a rock;
<lb/>And she, with the other burthen, drowned herself;--
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And at the time when fortune downward hurled
<lb/>The Trojan's arrogance, that all things dared,
<lb/>So that the king was with his kingdom crushed,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Hecuba sad, disconsolate, and captive,
<lb/>When lifeless she beheld Polyxena,
<lb/>And of her Polydorus on the shore
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Of ocean was the dolorous one aware,
<lb/>Out of her senses like a dog she barked,
<lb/>So much the anguish had her mind distorted;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But not of Thebes the furies nor the Trojan
<lb/>Were ever seen in any one so cruel
<lb/>In goading beasts, and much more human members,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>As I beheld two shadows pale and naked,
<lb/>Who, biting, in the manner ran along
<lb/>That a boar does, when from the sty turned loose.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>One to Capocchio came, and <punishment_phrase>by the nape
<lb/>Seized with its <torture_word synset="tooth.n.04">teeth</torture_word> his neck, so that in dragging
<lb/>It made his belly grate the solid bottom.</punishment_phrase>
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And the Aretine, who trembling had remained,
<lb/>Said to me: "That mad sprite is Gianni Schicchi,
<lb/>And raving goes thus harrying other people."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"O," said I to him, "so may not the other
<lb/>Set teeth on thee, let it not weary thee
<lb/>To tell us who it is, ere it dart hence."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And he to me: "That is the ancient ghost
<lb/>Of the nefarious Myrrha, who became
<lb/>Beyond all rightful love her father's lover.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>She came to sin with him after this manner,
<lb/>By counterfeiting of another's form;
<lb/>As he who goeth yonder undertook,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>That he might gain the lady of the herd,
<lb/>To counterfeit in himself Buoso Donati,

<stanza>
<lb/>And after the two maniacs had passed
<lb/>On whom I held mine eye, I turned it back

<lb/>Just at the point at which a man is forked.

<stanza>
<lb/>The heavy dropsy, that so disproportions

<lb/>That the face corresponds not to the belly,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Compelled him so to hold his lips apart
<lb/>As does the hectic, <punishment_phrase>who because of <torture_word synset="thirst.n.01">thirst</torture_word></punishment_phrase>
<lb/>One tow'rds the chin, the other upward turns.

<stanza>
<lb/>"O ye, who without any torment are,

<lb/>For which I left my body burned above.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But if I here could see the tristful soul
<lb/>Of Guido, or Alessandro, or their brother,
<lb/>For Branda's fount I would not give the sight.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>One is within already, if the raving
<lb/>Shades that are going round about speak truth;
<lb/>But what avails it me, whose limbs are tied?
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>If I were only still so light, that in
<lb/>A hundred years I could advance one inch,
<lb/>I had already started on the way,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Seeking him out among this squalid folk,
<lb/>Although the circuit be eleven miles,
<lb/>And be not less than half a mile across.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>For them am I in such a family;
<lb/>They did induce me into coining florins,
<lb/>Which had three carats of impurity."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And I to him: "Who are the two poor wretches
<lb/>That smoke like unto a wet hand in winter,
<lb/>Lying there close upon thy right-hand confines?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"I found them here," replied he, "when I rained
<lb/>Into this chasm, and since they have not turned,
<lb/>Nor do I think they will for evermore.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>One the false woman is who accused Joseph,
<lb/>The other the false Sinon, Greek of Troy;
<lb/>From acute fever they send forth such reek."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And one of them, who felt himself annoyed
<lb/>At being, peradventure, named so darkly,
<lb/>Smote with the fist upon his hardened paunch.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>It gave a sound, as if it were a drum;
<lb/>And Master Adam smote him in the face,
<lb/>With arm that did not seem to be less hard,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Saying to him: "Although be taken from me
<lb/>All motion, for my limbs that heavy are,
<lb/>I have an arm unfettered for such need."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Whereat he answer made: "When thou didst go
<lb/>Unto the fire, thou hadst it not so ready:
<lb/>But hadst it so and more when thou wast coining."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The dropsical: "Thou sayest true in that;
<lb/>But thou wast not so true a witness there,
<lb/>Where thou wast questioned of the truth at Troy."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"If I spake false, thou falsifiedst the coin,"
<lb/>Said Sinon; "and for one fault I am here,
<lb/>And thou for more than any other demon."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Remember, perjurer, about the horse,"
<lb/>He made reply who had the swollen belly,
<lb/>"And rueful be it thee the whole world knows it."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Rueful to thee the thirst be wherewith cracks
<lb/>Thy tongue," the Greek said, "and the putrid water
<lb/>That hedges so thy paunch before thine eyes."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then the false-coiner: "So is gaping wide
<lb/>Thy mouth for speaking evil, as 'tis wont;
<lb/>Because if I have thirst, and humour stuff me
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thou hast the burning and the head that aches,
<lb/>And to lick up the mirror of Narcissus
<lb/>Thou wouldst not want words many to invite thee."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>In listening to them was I wholly fixed,
<lb/>When said the Master to me: "Now just look,
<lb/>For little wants it that I quarrel with thee."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>When him I heard in anger speak to me,
<lb/>I turned me round towards him with such shame
<lb/>That still it eddies through my memory.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And as he is who dreams of his own harm,
<lb/>Who dreaming wishes it may be a dream,
<lb/>So that he craves what is, as if it were not;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Such I became, not having power to speak,
<lb/>For to excuse myself I wished, and still
<lb/>Excused myself, and did not think I did it.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Less shame doth wash away a greater fault,"
<lb/>The Master said, "than this of thine has been;
<lb/>Therefore thyself disburden of all sadness,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And make account that I am aye beside thee,
<lb/>If e'er it come to pass that fortune bring thee
<lb/>Where there are people in a like dispute;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>For a base wish it is to wish to hear it."
</stanza>

<canto numeral="XXXI"/>

<stanza>
<lb/>One and the selfsame tongue first wounded me,
<lb/>So that it tinged the one cheek and the other,
<lb/>And then held out to me the medicine;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thus do I hear that once Achilles' spear,
<lb/>His and his father's, used to be the cause
<lb/>First of a sad and then a gracious boon.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>We turned our backs upon the wretched valley,
<lb/>Upon the bank that girds it round about,
<lb/>Going across it without any speech.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>There it was less than night, and less than day,
<lb/>So that my sight went little in advance;
<lb/>But I could hear the blare of a loud horn,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>So loud it would have made each thunder faint,
<lb/>Which, counter to it following its way,
<lb/>Mine eyes directed wholly to one place.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>After the dolorous discomfiture
<lb/>When Charlemagne the holy emprise lost,
<lb/>So terribly Orlando sounded not.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Short while my head turned thitherward I held
<lb/>When many lofty towers I seemed to see,
<lb/>Whereat I: "Master, say, what town is this?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And he to me: "Because thou peerest forth
<lb/>Athwart the darkness at too great a distance,
<lb/>It happens that thou errest in thy fancy.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Well shalt thou see, if thou arrivest there,
<lb/>How much the sense deceives itself by distance;
<lb/>Therefore a little faster spur thee on."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then tenderly he took me by the hand,
<lb/>And said: "Before we farther have advanced,
<lb/>That the reality may seem to thee
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Less strange, know that these are not towers, but giants,
<lb/>And they are in the well, around the bank,
<lb/>From navel downward, one and all of them."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>As, when the fog is vanishing away,
<lb/>Little by little doth the sight refigure
<lb/>Whate'er the mist that crowds the air conceals,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>So, piercing through the dense and darksome air,
<lb/>More and more near approaching tow'rd the verge,
<lb/>My error fled, and fear came over me;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Because as on its circular parapets
<lb/>Montereggione crowns itself with towers,
<lb/>E'en thus the margin which surrounds the well
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>With one half of their bodies turreted
<lb/>The horrible giants, whom Jove menaces
<lb/>E'en now from out the heavens when he thunders.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And I of one already saw the face,
<lb/>Shoulders, and breast, and great part of the belly,
<lb/>And down along his sides both of the arms.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Certainly Nature, when she left the making
<lb/>Of animals like these, did well indeed,
<lb/>By taking such executors from Mars;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And if of elephants and whales she doth not
<lb/>Repent her, whosoever looketh subtly
<lb/>More just and more discreet will hold her for it;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>For where the argument of intellect
<lb/>Is added unto evil will and power,
<lb/>No rampart can the people make against it.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>His face appeared to me as long and large
<lb/>As is at Rome the pine-cone of Saint Peter's,
<lb/>And in proportion were the other bones;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>So that the margin, which an apron was
<lb/>Down from the middle, showed so much of him
<lb/>Above it, that to reach up to his hair
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Three Frieslanders in vain had vaunted them;
<lb/>For I beheld thirty great palms of him
<lb/>Down from the place where man his mantle buckles.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Raphael mai amech izabi almi,"
<lb/>Began to clamour the ferocious mouth,
<lb/>To which were not befitting sweeter psalms.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And unto him my Guide: "Soul idiotic,
<lb/>Keep to thy horn, and vent thyself with that,
<lb/>When wrath or other passion touches thee.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Search round thy neck, and thou wilt find the belt
<lb/>Which keeps it fastened, O bewildered soul,
<lb/>And see it, where it bars thy mighty breast."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then said to me: "He doth himself accuse;
<lb/>This one is Nimrod, by whose evil thought
<lb/>One language in the world is not still used.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Here let us leave him and not speak in vain;
<lb/>For even such to him is every language
<lb/>As his to others, which to none is known."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Therefore a longer journey did we make,
<lb/>Turned to the left, and a crossbow-shot oft
<lb/>We found another far more fierce and large.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>In binding him, who might the master be
<lb/>I cannot say; but he had pinioned close
<lb/>Behind the right arm, and in front the other,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>With chains, that held him so begirt about
<lb/>From the neck down, that on the part uncovered
<lb/>It wound itself as far as the fifth gyre.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"This proud one wished to make experiment
<lb/>Of his own power against the Supreme Jove,"
<lb/>My Leader said, "whence he has such a guerdon.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Ephialtes is his name; he showed great prowess.
<lb/>What time the giants terrified the gods;
<lb/>The arms he wielded never more he moves."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And I to him: "If possible, I should wish
<lb/>That of the measureless Briareus
<lb/>These eyes of mine might have experience."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Whence he replied: "Thou shalt behold Antaeus
<lb/>Close by here, who can speak and is unbound,
<lb/>Who at the bottom of all crime shall place us.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Much farther yon is he whom thou wouldst see,
<lb/>And he is bound, and fashioned like to this one,
<lb/>Save that he seems in aspect more ferocious."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>There never was an earthquake of such might
<lb/>That it could shake a tower so violently,
<lb/>As Ephialtes suddenly shook himself.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then was I more afraid of death than ever,
<lb/>For nothing more was needful than the fear,
<lb/>If I had not beheld the manacles.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then we proceeded farther in advance,
<lb/>And to Antaeus came, who, full five ells
<lb/>Without the head, forth issued from the cavern.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"O thou, who in the valley fortunate,
<lb/>Which Scipio the heir of glory made,
<lb/>When Hannibal turned back with all his hosts,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Once brought'st a thousand lions for thy prey,
<lb/>And who, hadst thou been at the mighty war
<lb/>Among thy brothers, some it seems still think
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The sons of Earth the victory would have gained:
<lb/>Place us below, nor be disdainful of it,
<lb/>There where the cold doth lock Cocytus up.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Make us not go to Tityus nor Typhoeus;
<lb/>This one can give of that which here is longed for;
<lb/>Therefore stoop down, and do not curl thy lip.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Still in the world can he restore thy fame;
<lb/>Because he lives, and still expects long life,
<lb/>If to itself Grace call him not untimely."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>So said the Master; and in haste the other
<lb/>His hands extended and took up my Guide,--
<lb/>Hands whose great pressure Hercules once felt.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Virgilius, when he felt himself embraced,
<lb/>Said unto me: "Draw nigh, that I may take thee;"
<lb/>Then of himself and me one bundle made.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>As seems the Carisenda, to behold
<lb/>Beneath the leaning side, when goes a cloud
<lb/>Above it so that opposite it hangs;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Such did Antaeus seem to me, who stood
<lb/>Watching to see him stoop, and then it was
<lb/>I could have wished to go some other way.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But lightly in the abyss, which swallows up
<lb/>Judas with Lucifer, he put us down;
<lb/>Nor thus bowed downward made he there delay,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>But, as a mast does in a ship, uprose.

</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Whereat I turned me round, and saw before me

<lb/>So thick a veil ne'er made upon its current
<lb/>In winter-time Danube in Austria,

<stanza>
<lb/>Livid, as far down as where shame appears,
<lb/>Were the disconsolate shades within the ice,
<lb/>Setting their teeth unto the note of storks.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Each one his countenance held downward bent;
<lb/>From mouth the cold, from eyes the doleful heart
<lb/>Among them witness of itself procures.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>When round about me somewhat I had looked,
<lb/>I downward turned me, and saw two so close,
<lb/>The hair upon their heads together mingled.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Ye who so strain your breasts together, tell me,"
<lb/>I said, "who are you;" and they bent their necks,
<lb/>And when to me their faces they had lifted,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Their eyes, which first were only moist within,
<lb/>Gushed o'er the eyelids, and the frost congealed
<lb/>The tears between, and locked them up again.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Clamp never bound together wood with wood
<lb/>So strongly; whereat they, like two he-goats,
<lb/>Butted together, so much wrath o'ercame them.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And one, who had by reason of the cold
<lb/>Lost both his ears, still with his visage downward,
<lb/>Said: "Why dost thou so mirror thyself in us?
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>If thou desire to know who these two are,
<lb/>The valley whence Bisenzio descends
<lb/>Belonged to them and to their father Albert.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>They from one body came, and all Caina
<lb/>Thou shalt search through, and shalt not find a shade
<lb/>More worthy to be fixed in gelatine;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Not he in whom were broken breast and shadow
<lb/>At one and the same blow by Arthur's hand;
<lb/>Focaccia not; not he who me encumbers
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>So with his head I see no farther forward,
<lb/>And bore the name of Sassol Mascheroni;
<lb/>Well knowest thou who he was, if thou art Tuscan.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And that thou put me not to further speech,
<lb/>Know that I Camicion de' Pazzi was,
<lb/>And wait Carlino to exonerate me."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then I beheld a thousand faces, made
<lb/>Purple with cold; whence o'er me comes a shudder,
<lb/>And evermore will come, at frozen ponds.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And while we were advancing tow'rds the middle,
<lb/>Where everything of weight unites together,
<lb/>And I was shivering in the eternal shade,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Whether 'twere will, or destiny, or chance,
<lb/>I know not; but in walking 'mong the heads
<lb/>I struck my foot hard in the face of one.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Weeping he growled: "Why dost thou trample me?
<lb/>Unless thou comest to increase the vengeance
<lb/>of Montaperti, why dost thou molest me?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And I: "My Master, now wait here for me,
<lb/>That I through him may issue from a doubt;
<lb/>Then thou mayst hurry me, as thou shalt wish."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The Leader stopped; and to that one I said

<lb/>"Who art thou, that thus reprehendest others?"

<stanza>
<lb/>"Now who art thou, that goest through Antenora

<stanza>
<lb/>"Living I am, and dear to thee it may be,"
<lb/>Was my response, "if thou demandest fame,

</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And he to me: "For the reverse I long;
<lb/>Take thyself hence, and give me no more trouble;

</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then by the scalp behind I seized upon him,

</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Whence he to me: "Though thou strip off my hair,
<lb/>I will not tell thee who I am, nor show thee,
<lb/>If on my head a thousand times thou fall."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I had his hair in hand already twisted,

</stanza>

<stanza>

<lb/>"Now," said I, "I care not to have thee speak,

<lb/>"Begone," replied he, "and tell what thou wilt,

<stanza>
<lb/>He weepeth here the silver of the French;

</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Already we had gone away from him,
<lb/>When I beheld two frozen in one hole,
<lb/>So that one head a hood was to the other;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And even as bread through hunger is devoured,
<lb/>The uppermost on the other set his teeth,
<lb/>There where the brain is to the nape united.

<stanza>
<lb/>"O thou, who showest by such bestial sign

<lb/>His mouth uplifted from his grim repast,
<lb/>That sinner, wiping it upon the hair

</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then he began: "Thou wilt that I renew
<lb/>The desperate grief, which wrings my heart already
<lb/>To think of only, ere I speak of it;

<stanza>
<lb/>But if my words be seed that may bear fruit

<stanza>
<lb/>That, by effect of his malicious thoughts,

<stanza>
<lb/>A narrow perforation in the mew,
<lb/>Which bears because of me the title of Famine,
<lb/>And in which others still must be locked up,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Had shown me through its opening many moons
<lb/>Already, when I dreamed the evil dream
<lb/>Which of the future rent for me the veil.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>This one appeared to me as lord and master,
<lb/>Hunting the wolf and whelps upon the mountain
<lb/>For which the Pisans cannot Lucca see.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>With sleuth-hounds gaunt, and eager, and well trained,
<lb/>Gualandi with Sismondi and Lanfianchi
<lb/>He had sent out before him to the front.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>After brief course seemed unto me forespent
<lb/>The father and the sons, and with sharp tushes
<lb/>It seemed to me I saw their flanks ripped open.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>When I before the morrow was awake,
<lb/>Moaning amid their sleep I heard my sons
<lb/>Who with me were, and asking after bread.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Cruel indeed art thou, if yet thou grieve not,
<lb/>Thinking of what my heart foreboded me,
<lb/>And weep'st thou not, what art thou wont to weep at?
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>They were awake now, and the hour drew nigh
<lb/>At which our food used to be brought to us,
<lb/>And through his dream was each one apprehensive;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And I heard locking up the under door
<lb/>Of the horrible tower; whereat without a word
<lb/>I gazed into the faces of my sons.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I wept not, I within so turned to stone;
<lb/>They wept; and darling little Anselm mine
<lb/>Said: 'Thou dost gaze so, father, what doth ail thee?'
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Still not a tear I shed, nor answer made
<lb/>All of that day, nor yet the night thereafter,
<lb/>Until another sun rose on the world.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>As now a little glimmer made its way
<lb/>Into the dolorous prison, and I saw
<lb/>Upon four faces my own very aspect,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Both of my hands in agony I bit;
<lb/>And, thinking that I did it from desire
<lb/>Of eating, on a sudden they uprose,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And said they: 'Father, much less pain 'twill give us
<lb/>If thou do eat of us; thyself didst clothe us
<lb/>With this poor flesh, and do thou strip it off.'
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I calmed me then, not to make them more sad.
<lb/>That day we all were silent, and the next.
<lb/>Ah! obdurate earth, wherefore didst thou not open?
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>When we had come unto the fourth day, Gaddo
<lb/>Threw himself down outstretched before my feet,
<lb/>Saying, 'My father, why dost thou not help me?'
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And there he died; and, as thou seest me,
<lb/>I saw the three fall, one by one, between
<lb/>The fifth day and the sixth; whence I betook me,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Already blind, to groping over each,
<lb/>And three days called them after they were dead;
<lb/>Then hunger did what sorrow could not do."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>When he had said this, with his eyes distorted,
<lb/>The wretched skull resumed he with his teeth,
<lb/>Which, as a dog's, upon the bone were strong.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Ah! Pisa, thou opprobrium of the people
<lb/>Of the fair land there where the 'Si' doth sound,
<lb/>Since slow to punish thee thy neighbours are,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Let the Capraia and Gorgona move,
<lb/>And make a hedge across the mouth of Arno
<lb/>That every person in thee it may drown!
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>For if Count Ugolino had the fame
<lb/>Of having in thy castles thee betrayed,
<lb/>Thou shouldst not on such cross have put his sons.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Guiltless of any crime, thou modern Thebes!
<lb/>Their youth made Uguccione and Brigata,
<lb/>And the other two my song doth name above!
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>We passed still farther onward, where the ice
<lb/>Another people ruggedly enswathes,
<lb/>Not downward turned, but all of them reversed.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Weeping itself there does not let them weep,
<lb/>And grief that finds a barrier in the eyes
<lb/>Turns itself inward to increase the anguish;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Because the earliest tears a cluster form,
<lb/>And, in the manner of a crystal visor,
<lb/>Fill all the cup beneath the eyebrow full.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And notwithstanding that, as in a callus,
<lb/>Because of cold all sensibility
<lb/>Its station had abandoned in my face,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Still it appeared to me I felt some wind;
<lb/>Whence I: "My Master, who sets this in motion?
<lb/>Is not below here every vapour quenched?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Whence he to me: "Full soon shalt thou be where
<lb/>Thine eye shall answer make to thee of this,
<lb/>Seeing the cause which raineth down the blast."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And one of the wretches of the frozen crust
<lb/>Cried out to us: "O souls so merciless
<lb/>That the last post is given unto you,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Lift from mine eyes the rigid veils, that I
<lb/>May vent the sorrow which impregns my heart
<lb/>A little, e'er the weeping recongeal."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Whence I to him: "If thou wouldst have me help thee
<lb/>Say who thou wast; and if I free thee not,
<lb/>May I go to the bottom of the ice."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then he replied: "I am Friar Alberigo;
<lb/>He am I of the fruit of the bad garden,
<lb/>Who here a date am getting for my fig."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"O," said I to him, "now art thou, too, dead?"
<lb/>And he to me: "How may my body fare
<lb/>Up in the world, no knowledge I possess.

<lb/>Saying: "Behold Dis, and behold the place
<lb/>Where thou with fortitude must arm thyself."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>How frozen I became and powerless then,
<lb/>Ask it not, Reader, for I write it not,
<lb/>Because all language would be insufficient.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I did not die, and I alive remained not;
<lb/>Think for thyself now, hast thou aught of wit,
<lb/>What I became, being of both deprived.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The Emperor of the kingdom dolorous
<lb/>From his mid-breast forth issued from the ice;
<lb/>And better with a giant I compare
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Than do the giants with those arms of his;
<lb/>Consider now how great must be that whole,
<lb/>Which unto such a part conforms itself.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Were he as fair once, as he now is foul,
<lb/>And lifted up his brow against his Maker,
<lb/>Well may proceed from him all tribulation.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>O, what a marvel it appeared to me,
<lb/>When I beheld three faces on his head!
<lb/>The one in front, and that vermilion was;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Two were the others, that were joined with this
<lb/>Above the middle part of either shoulder,
<lb/>And they were joined together at the crest;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And the right-hand one seemed 'twixt white and yellow;
<lb/>The left was such to look upon as those
<lb/>Who come from where the Nile falls valley-ward.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Underneath each came forth two mighty wings,
<lb/>Such as befitting were so great a bird;
<lb/>Sails of the sea I never saw so large.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/> No feathers had they, but as of a bat
<lb/>Their fashion was; and he was waving them,
<lb/>So that three winds proceeded forth therefrom.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thereby Cocytus wholly was congealed.
<lb/>With six eyes did he weep, and down three chins
<lb/>Trickled the tear-drops and the bloody drivel.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>At every mouth he with his teeth was crunching
<lb/>A sinner, in the manner of a brake,
<lb/>So that he three of them tormented thus.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>To him in front the biting was as naught
<lb/>Unto the clawing, for sometimes the spine
<lb/>Utterly stripped of all the skin remained.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"That soul up there which has the greatest pain,"
<lb/>The Master said, "is Judas Iscariot;
<lb/>With head inside, he plies his legs without.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Of the two others, who head downward are,
<lb/>The one who hangs from the black jowl is Brutus;
<lb/>See how he writhes himself, and speaks no word.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And the other, who so stalwart seems, is Cassius.
<lb/>But night is reascending, and 'tis time
<lb/>That we depart, for we have seen the whole."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>As seemed him good, I clasped him round the neck,
<lb/>And he the vantage seized of time and place,
<lb/>And when the wings were opened wide apart,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>He laid fast hold upon the shaggy sides;
<lb/>From fell to fell descended downward then
<lb/>Between the thick hair and the frozen crust.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>When we were come to where the thigh revolves
<lb/>Exactly on the thickness of the haunch,
<lb/>The Guide, with labour and with hard-drawn breath,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Turned round his head where he had had his legs,
<lb/>And grappled to the hair, as one who mounts,
<lb/>So that to Hell I thought we were returning.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Keep fast thy hold, for by such stairs as these,"
<lb/>The Master said, panting as one fatigued,
<lb/>"Must we perforce depart from so much evil."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Then through the opening of a rock he issued,
<lb/>And down upon the margin seated me;
<lb/>Then tow'rds me he outstretched his wary step.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>I lifted up mine eyes and thought to see
<lb/>Lucifer in the same way I had left him;
<lb/>And I beheld him upward hold his legs.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And if I then became disquieted,
<lb/>Let stolid people think who do not see
<lb/>What the point is beyond which I had passed.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Rise up," the Master said, "upon thy feet;
<lb/>The way is long, and difficult the road,
<lb/>And now the sun to middle-tierce returns."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>It was not any palace corridor
<lb/>There where we were, but dungeon natural,
<lb/>With floor uneven and unease of light.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>"Ere from the abyss I tear myself away,
<lb/>My Master," said I when I had arisen,
<lb/>"To draw me from an error speak a little;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Where is the ice? and how is this one fixed
<lb/>Thus upside down? and how in such short time
<lb/>From eve to morn has the sun made his transit?"
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And he to me: "Thou still imaginest
<lb/>Thou art beyond the centre, where I grasped
<lb/>The hair of the fell worm, who mines the world.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>That side thou wast, so long as I descended;
<lb/>When round I turned me, thou didst pass the point
<lb/>To which things heavy draw from every side,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And now beneath the hemisphere art come
<lb/>Opposite that which overhangs the vast
<lb/>Dry-land, and 'neath whose cope was put to death
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The Man who without sin was born and lived.
<lb/>Thou hast thy feet upon the little sphere
<lb/>Which makes the other face of the Judecca.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Here it is morn when it is evening there;
<lb/>And he who with his hair a stairway made us
<lb/>Still fixed remaineth as he was before.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Upon this side he fell down out of heaven;
<lb/>And all the land, that whilom here emerged,
<lb/>For fear of him made of the sea a veil,
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>And came to our hemisphere; and peradventure
<lb/>To flee from him, what on this side appears
<lb/>Left the place vacant here, and back recoiled."
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>A place there is below, from Beelzebub
<lb/>As far receding as the tomb extends,
<lb/>Which not by sight is known, but by the sound
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Of a small rivulet, that there descendeth
<lb/>Through chasm within the stone, which it has gnawed
<lb/>With course that winds about and slightly falls.
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>The Guide and I into that hidden road
<lb/>Now entered, to return to the bright world;
<lb/>And without care of having any rest
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>We mounted up, he first and I the second,
<lb/>Till I beheld through a round aperture
<lb/>Some of the beauteous things that Heaven doth bear;
</stanza>

<stanza>
<lb/>Thence we came forth to rebehold the stars.
