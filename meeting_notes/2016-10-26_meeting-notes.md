## New stuff

### General

* No MALLET

### Emma and Jessica

* Think about how to use WordNet in project (see [David's email](http://dh.obdurodon.org/drupal/comment/4131#comment-4131))
* Hand tag sample text to explore adequacy of schema; modify schema as needed (middle)
* Hand tag all pain and torture, changing schema "text" values to controlled vocabularies (or-lists of strings) as needed

### Jessica

* Blog post

### Nikki (assisted by Meghan)

* Webmaster (will oversee HTML and CSS)
* Plan CSS. Notes should be in [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and pushed to GitHub in **web** subdirectory.
* All participants will look for images; Nikki will coordinate

## For later

* Read about image maps (see the links to tutorials at <http://designreviver.com/tutorials/css-image-map-techniques-and-tutorials/>; pick any one that looks interesting). Will eventually use image map of hell for textual navigation.
