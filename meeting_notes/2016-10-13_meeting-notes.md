Description should be in [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and should be pushed to GitHub in **web** subdirectory. Creating sample HTML or CSS is optional this week; if you do create some content for publication, it should be uploaded to /var/www/html/dante (ask for help if you have trouble finding it).
