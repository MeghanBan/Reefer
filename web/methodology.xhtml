            <h1>Markup Methodology</h1>

            <h2>Structural Mark-up</h2>

            <p>One of the most time consuming parts of this project was the initial structural
                mark-up of the text and schema development. The problem stemmed from discrepancies
                in the structure of the poem itself and the mark-up we wanted to put. The layout of
                the poem by Dante Alighieri is broken into lines, stanzas, and cantos. In the poem,
                however, the character Dante is travelling through the circles of Hell, some of
                which have their own pouches or rings. These circles, pouches and rings, however, do
                not line up with the cantos. Circles span cantos and they are unpredictable in where
                they begin and terminate. Because of this, creating &lt;canto&gt; and &lt;circle&gt;
                elements would have violated the XML hierarchy and resulted in an invalid XML
                document. Another problem we ran into was that of marking up pain and torture. In
                this case, pain and torture spanned lines, and if we created &lt;line&gt; elements
                it would have resulted in the same issue as above. What we decided to do instead was
                create empty elements, or milestone tags. Instead of having &lt;line&gt; tags
                wrapping the lines, we have &lt;lb/&gt; tags at the beginning of each line
                signifying &lt;line beginning&gt; and &lt;canto/&gt; tags marking the beginning of
                each canto. That way circles could span cantos and pain and torture could span
                lines, and there would be no violation of the hierarchy. </p>

            <h2>Content Mark-up</h2>

            <p>As our goal of the project was to examine the language surrounding pain and torture
                in Hell, we, obviously, needed to mark up instances of pain and torture. We
                distinguished between pain and torture by classifying &lt;pain&gt; as experienced by
                the sinner, and &lt;torture&gt; as the act inflicting pain on the sinner. As
                mentioned above, we initially had the problem of figuring out how to tag pain and
                torture that spanned lines without violating the integrity of the XML hierarchy,
                which we solved by creating empty &lt;lb/&gt; tags to mark line beginnings. In our
                first, rough mark-up, we tagged instances of pain and torture in &lt;pain_phrase&gt;
                and &lt;torture_phrase&gt; elements respectively. We tagged phrases rather than
                words because much of the time, pain and torture were not expressed in only one
                word, but rather in long, poetic phrases. With our inclusion of WordNet, however,
                not having individually tagged words posed yet another problem. WordNet is a large
                lexical database of English that groups words into cognitive synonyms, or synsets,
                based on their part-of-speech. Each synset expresses a different meaning of the
                word. WordNet acts, in the simplest of explanations, as a sort of thesaurus. An
                important distinction between WordNet and a thesaurus, however, is that WordNet
                groups not just definitions, but also senses of words. WordNet also labels semantic
                relations between words, where a thesaurus does not. WordNet processes words, not
                phrases, and it was there that the problem with &lt;pain_phrase&gt; and
                &lt;torture_phrase&gt; tags lay. Another problem with those tags were that there was
                instances of punishment that were not necessarily instances of pain or torture,
                exactly. We still wanted to capture the instances of that language though, because
                they were also important data points. What we did to fix both problems was, using
                Regular Expressions, change all &lt;pain_phrase&gt; and &lt;torture_phrase&gt;
                elements into &lt;punishment_phrase&gt; elements. &lt;punishment_phrase&gt;
                elements, then, had optional child &lt;pain_word&gt; and &lt;torture_word&gt;
                elements. That way, we were able to capture the full phrase of punishment while
                still tagging individual words so that WordNet could process them.</p>

            <h2>Limitations</h2>

            <p>Our main limitation was time. As this project was confined to the course of one
                semester, we were very limited in what we were able to do. This project was very
                involved, and combined with all of our course loads, it proved impossible to
                complete it in full. Thus, this project is a proof of concept. We did enough mark-up
                to be able to capture data to analyze, and we did enough analysis that we were able
                to draw preliminary conclusions. We did not mark up the entire text. The whole text
                has structural mark-up (line beginnings, stanzas, cantos, circles, and
                pouches/rings), however the content mark-up is not complete. We started the mark-up
                of pain and torture in the middle of the poem, as the beginning of the poem is
                mainly talking and description, and the particularly painful and torturous parts do
                not really begin until Dante gets deeper into Hell. Content mark-up begins at canto
                IX and goes through canto XXX. We also ran WordNet analysis on only
                &lt;torture_word&gt; elements, and not &lt;pain_word&gt; elements. Another
                limitation was WordNet. This project needed to be linguistics-based for our two
                Linguistics majors in the group, and WordNet was able to provide heavily
                semantics-based interpretation. We decided to use this technology at the beginning
                of the semester before we fully understood our project and our goals, and it became
                clear that WordNet was not the ideal technology for us. However we were in too deep
                (into the semester and our project) to make any more drastic changes, so we pursued
                the use of WordNet. Using WordNet required learning Python, which none of us had
                very much experience with, and reading through each synset of each word, choosing
                one, and manually marking it up in the text. A lot of our time ended up going
                towards WordNet. Had we not been dealing with that technology, we could have gotten
                further on other analysis. </p>

            <h2>Ideas for Future Research</h2>

            <p>If we were to continue this project, we would complete the mark-up of pain and
                torture. We might think about not continuing with WordNet, and instead utilizing
                MALLET for topic modeling. Unlike WordNet, MALLET could provide us with groups of
                words that occur frequently near each other, ideally showing us the different theme
                or topic, rather, that each circle focused on. As our original research question
                looked at comparing the language surrounding punishment in each of the nine circles
                of Hell, topic modeling could provide us with an ideal overview of the words used in
                each circle. We would also make sure that the content mark-up was much more thorough
                and consistent. The mark-up was done primarily by two members of our group. Because
                deciding what is painful or torturous language is subjective in itself, having two
                different people do it created even more subjectivity and discrepancies. Given the
                time, we would go through the text a few more times and make sure to standardize
                further the words we chose as pain words and torture words, and the phrases we
                tagged as &lt;punishment_phrase&gt;. The fact that this text was translated from the
                original Italian creates even more confounding variables. No one in our group knows
                Italian, so we were unable to do analysis of the original text. However given the
                time and the resources, doing a similar project with the Italian text would be
                interesting and also beneficial when comparing it to the English text.</p>
